[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/openaustralia/morph.png?label=ready)](https://waffle.io/openaustralia/morph) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openaustralia/morph.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openaustralia/morph) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/openaustralia/morph.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/openaustralia/morph)

## morph.io: A scraping platform

* A [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for [Scrapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)
* All code and collaboration through [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* Write your scrapers in Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl or JavaScript (NodeJS, PhantomJS)
* Simple API to grab data
* Schedule scrapers or run manually
* Process isolation via [Docker](http://www.docker.io/)
* Trivial to move scraper code and data from [ScraperWiki Classic](https://classic.scraperwiki.com/)
* Email alerts for broken scrapers

### Dependencies
Ruby 2.0.0, Docker, MySQL, SQLite 3, Redis, mitmproxy and Elasticsearch.

On OS X for development also Kitematic - see below for more.

On Linux your user account should be able to manipulate Docker (just add your user to the `docker` group).

### Repositories

User-facing:

* [openaustralia/morph](https://github.com/openaustralia/morph) - Main application
* [openaustralia/morph-cli](https://github.com/openaustralia/morph-cli) - Command-line morph.io tool
* [openaustralia/scraperwiki-python](https://github.com/openaustralia/scraperwiki-python) - Fork of [scraperwiki/scraperwiki-python](https://github.com/scraperwiki/scraperwiki-python) updated to use morph.io naming conventions
* [openaustralia/scraperwiki-ruby](https://github.com/openaustralia/scraperwiki-ruby) - Fork of [scraperwiki/scraperwiki-ruby](https://github.com/scraperwiki/scraperwiki-ruby) updated to use morph.io naming conventions

Docker images:

* [openaustralia/buildstep](https://github.com/openaustralia/buildstep) - Fork of [progrium/buildstep](https://github.com/progrium/buildstep) which uses the image openaustralia/morph-docker-buildstep-base as its base

### To Install

Running this on OSX? Read the [OSX instructions](#installing-docker-on-osx) below BEFORE doing any of this.

    bundle install
    cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
    cp env-example .env

Edit `config/database.yml` with your database settings

Create an [application on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) so that morph.io can talk to GitHub. Fill in the following values

* Application name: __Morph (dev)__
* Homepage URL: __http://127.0.0.1:3000__
* Authorization callback URL: __http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/auth/github/callback__
* Application description: You can leave this blank

Note the use of 127.0.0.1 rather than localhost. Use this or it won't work.

In the `.env` file, fill in the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* details provided by GitHub for the application you've just created.

Now setup the databases:

    bundle exec dotenv rake db:setup

Now you can start the server

    bundle exec dotenv foreman start

and point your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

To get started, log in with GitHub. There is a simple admin interface
accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin). To
access this, run the following to give your account admin rights:

    bundle exec rake app:promote_to_admin

### Installing Docker on OSX

If you're doing your development on Linux you're in luck because installing Docker is pretty straightforward. Just follow the instructions on the [Docker site](http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation).

Install [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/). This will also, I think, prompt
you to install VirtualBox if you don't already have it.

Then, from the command-line
```
docker-machine env
```

Paste the output of that command into the docker section of the `.env` file.
Now the application will know how to contact the docker server running on
a VM on your machine.

### Running tests

If you're running guard (see above) the tests will also automatically run when you change a file.

By default, RSpec will skip tests that have been tagged as being slow. To change this behaviour, add the following to your `.env`:

    RUN_SLOW_TESTS=1

By default, RSpec will run certain tests against a running Docker server. These tests are quite slow, but not have been tagged as slow. To stop Rspec from running these tests, add the following to your `.env`:

    DONT_RUN_DOCKER_TESTS=1

#### Guard Livereload

We use Guard and Livereload so that whenever you edit a view in development the web page gets automatically reloaded. It's a massive time saver when you're doing design or lots of work in the view. To make it work run

    bundle exec guard

Guard will also run tests when needed. Some tests do integration tests against a
running docker server. These particular tests are very slow. If you want to
disable them,

```
DONT_RUN_DOCKER_TESTS=1 bundle exec guard
```

### Mail in development

By default in development mails are sent to [Mailcatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/). To install

    gem install mailcatcher

### Deploying to production

This section will not be relevant to most people. It will however be relevant if you're deploying to a production server.

#### git-encrypt

We're using [git-encrypt](https://github.com/shadowhand/git-encrypt) to encrypt certain files, like the private key for the SSL certificate. To make this work you have to do some [special things](https://github.com/shadowhand/git-encrypt#decrypting-clones) _before_ you clone the morph repository.

#### Production devops development

Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/). Comment out the user line in [`provisioning/playbook.yml`](https://github.com/openaustralia/morph/blob/17e05ed5bc540be683e5fdf90d1fefaa0f81c56f/provisioning/playbook.yml#L10-L11) and run `vagrant up local`. This will build and provision a box that looks and acts like production at `dev.morph.io`.

Add these lines to your `/etc/hosts` file:

    192.168.11.2  dev.morph.io
    192.168.11.2  faye.dev.morph.io
    192.168.11.2  api.dev.morph.io
    192.168.11.2  discuss.dev.morph.io

Once the box is created and provisioned, deploy the application to your Vagrant box:

    cap local deploy

Now visit https://dev.morph.io/

#### Production provisioning and deployment

To deploy morph.io to production, normally you'll just want to deploy using Capistrano:

    cap production deploy

When you've changed the Ansible playbooks to modify the infrastructure you'll want to run:

    ansible-playbook --user=root --inventory-file=provisioning/hosts provisioning/playbook.yml

### How to contribute

If you find what looks like a bug:

* Check the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/openaustralia/morph/issues/)
  to see if anyone else has reported issue.
* If you don't see anything, create an issue with information on how to reproduce it.

If you want to contribute an enhancement or a fix:

* Fork the project on GitHub.
* Make your changes with tests.
* Commit the changes without making changes to any files that aren't related to your enhancement or fix.
* Send a pull request.

We maintain a list of [issues that are easy fixes](https://github.com/openaustralia/morph/issues?labels=easy+fix&milestone=&page=1&state=open). Fixing
one of these is a great way to get started while you get familiar with the codebase.
