# This playbook is for provisioning on a Linode box. It should be at least a Linode 24576 box and have
# 64 bit Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with 256 MB swap.
#
# To run in development:
# vagrant provision local
#
# To run in production:
# ansible-playbook --user=root -i provisioning/hosts provisioning/playbook.yml
#
# Run this from the root directory so that it picks up the ansible.cfg
# and so knows where to look for the ansible vault password

# To get the value of an encrypted variable:
# ansible morph.io -i provisioning/hosts -m debug -a "var=github_app_client_id"

# Ubuntu 16.04 LTS doesn't come with python pre-installed. We need that for
# Ansible to work (for the gather facts). So install python first
