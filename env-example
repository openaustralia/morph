# Secret configuration in .env

# Copy this to .env and fill in the x's for development (ansible creates the .env on staging/production servers)
# Similarly copy env-staging-example to .env.staging if the staging variables differ from development
# These values are then automatically loaded as environment variables in the ruby app
# See https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv for more information
