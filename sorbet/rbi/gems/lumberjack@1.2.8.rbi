#   logger.fatal("OMG the application is on fire!")
#
# Log entries are written to a logging Device if their severity meets or exceeds the log level.
#
# Devices may use buffers internally and the log entries are not guaranteed to be written until you call
# the +flush+ method. Sometimes this can result in problems when trying to track down extraordinarily
# long running sections of code since it is likely that none of the messages logged before the long
# running code will appear in the log until the entire process finishes. You can set the +:flush_seconds+
# option on the constructor to force the device to be flushed periodically. This will create a new
# monitoring thread, but its use is highly recommended.
#
# Each log entry records the log message and severity along with the time it was logged, the
# program name, process id, and unit of work id. The message will be converted to a string, but
# otherwise, it is up to the device how these values are recorded. Messages are converted to strings
# using a Formatter associated with the logger.

  # If it is :null, it will be a Null device that won't record any output.
  # Otherwise, it will be assumed to be file path and wrapped in a Device::LogFile class.
  #
  # This method can take the following options:
  #
  # * :level - The logging level below which messages will be ignored.
  # * :formatter - The formatter to use for outputting messages to the log.

  # * :tag_formatter - The TagFormatter to use for formatting tags.
  # * :progname - The name of the program that will be recorded with each log entry.
  # * :flush_seconds - The maximum number of seconds between flush calls.
