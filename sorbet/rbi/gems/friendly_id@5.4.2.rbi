# ## About FriendlyId
#
# FriendlyId is an add-on to Ruby's Active Record that allows you to replace ids
# in your URLs with strings:
#
#     # without FriendlyId
#     http://example.com/states/4323454
#
#     # with FriendlyId
#     http://example.com/states/washington
#
# It requires few changes to your application code and offers flexibility,
# performance and a well-documented codebase.
#
# ### Core Concepts
#
# #### Slugs
#
# The concept of *slugs* is at the heart of FriendlyId.
#
# A slug is the part of a URL which identifies a page using human-readable
# keywords, rather than an opaque identifier such as a numeric id. This can make
# your application more friendly both for users and search engines.
#
# #### Finders: Slugs Act Like Numeric IDs
#
# To the extent possible, FriendlyId lets you treat text-based identifiers like
# normal IDs. This means that you can perform finds with slugs just like you do
# with numeric ids:
#
#     Person.find(82542335)
#     Person.friendly.find("joe")
#
# source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/base.rb:1
module FriendlyId
  class << self
    # Set global defaults for all models using FriendlyId.
    #
    # The default defaults are to use the `:reserved` module and nothing else.
    #
    # @example
    #   FriendlyId.defaults do |config|
    #   config.base :name
    #   config.use :slugged
    #   end
    #
    # source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id.rb:104
    def defaults(&block); end

    # FriendlyId takes advantage of `extended` to do basic model setup, primarily
    # extending {FriendlyId::Base} to add {FriendlyId::Base#friendly_id
    # friendly_id} as a class method.
    #
    # Previous versions of FriendlyId simply patched ActiveRecord::Base, but this
    # version tries to be less invasive.
    #
    # In addition to adding {FriendlyId::Base#friendly_id friendly_id}, the class
    # instance variable +@friendly_id_config+ is added. This variable is an
    # instance of an anonymous subclass of {FriendlyId::Configuration}. This
    # allows subsequently loaded modules like {FriendlyId::Slugged} and
    # {FriendlyId::Scoped} to add functionality to the configuration class only
    # for the current class, rather than monkey patching
    # {FriendlyId::Configuration} directly. This isolates other models from large
    # feature changes an addon to FriendlyId could potentially introduce.
    #
    # The upshot of this is, you can have two Active Record models that both have
    # a @friendly_id_config, but each config object can have different methods
    # and behaviors depending on what modules have been loaded, without
    # conflicts.  Keep this in mind if you're hacking on FriendlyId.
    #
    # For examples of this, see the source for {Scoped.included}.
    #
    # source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id.rb:77
    def extended(model_class); end

    # Allow developers to `include` FriendlyId or `extend` it.
    #
    # source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id.rb:91
    def included(model_class); end

    # source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/object_utils.rb:62
    def mark_as_unfriendly(klass); end

    # Set the ActiveRecord table name prefix to friendly_id_
    #
    # This makes 'slugs' into 'friendly_id_slugs' and also respects any
    # 'global' table_name_prefix set on ActiveRecord::Base.
    #
    # source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id.rb:113
    def table_name_prefix; end
  end
end

# ## Setting Up FriendlyId in Your Model
#
# To use FriendlyId in your ActiveRecord models, you must first either extend or
# include the FriendlyId module (it makes no difference), then invoke the
# {FriendlyId::Base#friendly_id friendly_id} method to configure your desired
# options:
#
#     class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
#       include FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :bar, :use => [:slugged, :simple_i18n]
#     end
#
# The most important option is `:use`, which you use to tell FriendlyId which
# addons it should use. See the documentation for {FriendlyId::Base#friendly_id} for a list of all
# available addons, or skim through the rest of the docs to get a high-level
# overview.
#
# *A note about single table inheritance (STI): you must extend FriendlyId in
# all classes that participate in STI, both your parent classes and their
# children.*
#
# ### The Default Setup: Simple Models
#
# The simplest way to use FriendlyId is with a model that has a uniquely indexed
# column with no spaces or special characters, and that is seldom or never
# updated. The most common example of this is a user name:
#
#     class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :login
#       validates_format_of :login, :with => /\A[a-z0-9]+\z/i
#     end
#
#     @user = User.friendly.find "joe"   # the old User.find(1) still works, too
#     @user.to_param                     # returns "joe"
#     redirect_to @user                  # the URL will be /users/joe
#
# In this case, FriendlyId assumes you want to use the column as-is; it will never
# modify the value of the column, and your application should ensure that the
# value is unique and admissible in a URL:
#
#     class City < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :name
#     end
#
#     @city.friendly.find "Viña del Mar"
#     redirect_to @city # the URL will be /cities/Viña%20del%20Mar
#
# Writing the code to process an arbitrary string into a good identifier for use
# in a URL can be repetitive and surprisingly tricky, so for this reason it's
# often better and easier to use {FriendlyId::Slugged slugs}.
#
# source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/base.rb:58
module FriendlyId::Base
  # Returns a scope that includes the friendly finders.
  #
  # @see FriendlyId::FinderMethods
  #
  # source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/base.rb:217
  def friendly; end

  # Configure FriendlyId's behavior in a model.
  #
  #     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged
  #     end
  #
  # When given the optional block, this method will yield the class's instance
  # of {FriendlyId::Configuration} to the block before evaluating other
  # arguments, so configuration values set in the block may be overwritten by
  # the arguments. This order was chosen to allow passing the same proc to
  # multiple models, while being able to override the values it sets. Here is
  # a contrived example:
  #
  #     $friendly_id_config_proc = Proc.new do |config|
  #       config.base = :name
  #       config.use :slugged
  #     end
  #
  #     class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id &$friendly_id_config_proc
  #     end
  #
  #     class Bar < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :title, &$friendly_id_config_proc
  #     end
  #
  # However, it's usually better to use {FriendlyId.defaults} for this:
  #
  #     FriendlyId.defaults do |config|
  #       config.base = :name
  #       config.use :slugged
  #     end
  #
  #     class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #     end
  #
  #     class Bar < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :title
  #     end
  #
  # In general you should use the block syntax either because of your personal
  # aesthetic preference, or because you need to share some functionality
  # between multiple models that can't be well encapsulated by
  # {FriendlyId.defaults}.
  #
  # ### Order Method Calls in a Block vs Ordering Options
  #
  # When calling this method without a block, you may set the hash options in
  # any order.
  #
  # However, when using block-style invocation, be sure to call
  # FriendlyId::Configuration's {FriendlyId::Configuration#use use} method
  # *prior* to the associated configuration options, because it will include
  # modules into your class, and these modules in turn may add required
  # configuration options to the `@friendly_id_configuraton`'s class:
  #
  #     class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       friendly_id do |config|
  #         # This will work
  #         config.use :slugged
  #         config.sequence_separator = ":"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       friendly_id do |config|
  #         # This will fail
  #         config.sequence_separator = ":"
  #         config.use :slugged
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # ### Including Your Own Modules
  #
  # Because :use can accept a name or a Module, {FriendlyId.defaults defaults}
  # can be a convenient place to set up behavior common to all classes using
  # FriendlyId. You can include any module, or more conveniently, define one
  # on-the-fly. For example, let's say you want to make
  # [Babosa](http://github.com/norman/babosa) the default slugging library in
  # place of Active Support, and transliterate all slugs from Russian Cyrillic
  # to ASCII:
  #
  #     require "babosa"
  #
  #     FriendlyId.defaults do |config|
  #       config.base = :name
  #       config.use :slugged
  #       config.use Module.new {
  #         def normalize_friendly_id(text)
  #           text.to_slug.normalize! :transliterations => [:russian, :latin]
  #         end
  #       }

# ## Performing Finds with FriendlyId
#
# FriendlyId offers enhanced finders which will search for your record by
# friendly id, and fall back to the numeric id if necessary. This makes it easy
# to add FriendlyId to an existing application with minimal code modification.
#
# By default, these methods are available only on the `friendly` scope:
#
#     Restaurant.friendly.find('plaza-diner') #=> works
#     Restaurant.friendly.find(23)            #=> also works
#     Restaurant.find(23)                     #=> still works
#     Restaurant.find('plaza-diner')          #=> will not work
#
# ### Restoring FriendlyId 4.0-style finders
#
# Prior to version 5.0, FriendlyId overrode the default finder methods to perform
# friendly finds all the time. This required modifying parts of Rails that did
# not have a public API, which was harder to maintain and at times caused
# compatiblity problems. In 5.0 we decided to change the library's defaults and add
# the friendly finder methods only to the `friendly` scope in order to boost
# compatiblity. However, you can still opt-in to original functionality very
# easily by using the `:finders` addon:
#
#     class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#
#       scope :active, -> {where(:active => true)}
#
#       friendly_id :name, :use => [:slugged, :finders]
#     end
#
#     Restaurant.friendly.find('plaza-diner') #=> works
#     Restaurant.find('plaza-diner')          #=> now also works
#     Restaurant.active.find('plaza-diner')   #=> now also works
#
# ### Updating your application to use FriendlyId's finders
#
# Unless you've chosen to use the `:finders` addon, be sure to modify the finders
# in your controllers to use the `friendly` scope. For example:
#
#     # before
#     def set_restaurant
#       @restaurant = Restaurant.find(params[:id])
#     end
#
#     # after
#     def set_restaurant
#       @restaurant = Restaurant.friendly.find(params[:id])
#     end
#
# #### Active Admin
#
# Unless you use the `:finders` addon, you should modify your admin controllers
# for models that use FriendlyId with something similar to the following:
#
#     controller do
#       def find_resource
#         scoped_collection.friendly.find(params[:id])
#       end
#     end
#
# source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/finders.rb:65
module FriendlyId::Finders
  class << self
    # source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/finders.rb:76
    def setup(model_class); end
  end
end

# source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/finders.rb:67
module FriendlyId::Finders::ClassMethods; end

# ## History: Avoiding 404's When Slugs Change
#
# FriendlyId's {FriendlyId::History History} module adds the ability to store a
# log of a model's slugs, so that when its friendly id changes, it's still
# possible to perform finds by the old id.
#
# The primary use case for this is avoiding broken URLs.
#
# ### Setup
#
# In order to use this module, you must add a table to your database schema to
# store the slug records. FriendlyId provides a generator for this purpose:
#
#     rails generate friendly_id
#     rake db:migrate
#
# This will add a table named `friendly_id_slugs`, used by the {FriendlyId::Slug}
# model.
#
# ### Considerations
#
# Because recording slug history requires creating additional database records,
# this module has an impact on the performance of the associated model's `create`
# method.
#
# ### Example
#
#     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :title, :use => :history
#     end
#

# Utility methods for determining whether any object is a friendly id.
#
# Monkey-patching Object is a somewhat extreme measure not to be taken lightly
# by libraries, but in this case I decided to do it because to me, it feels
# cleaner than adding a module method to {FriendlyId}. I've given the methods
# names that unambigously refer to the library of their origin, which should
# be sufficient to avoid conflicts with other libraries.
#
# source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/object_utils.rb:21
module FriendlyId::ObjectUtils
  # True if the id is definitely friendly, false if definitely unfriendly,
  # else nil.
  #
  # An object is considired "definitely unfriendly" if its class is or
  # inherits from ActiveRecord::Base, Array, Hash, NilClass, Numeric, or
  # Symbol.
  #
  # An object is considered "definitely friendly" if it responds to +to_i+,
  # and its value when cast to an integer and then back to a string is
  # different from its value when merely cast to a string:
  #
  #     123.friendly_id?                  #=> false
  #     :id.friendly_id?                  #=> false

# ## Reserved Words
#
# The {FriendlyId::Reserved Reserved} module adds the ability to exclude a list of
# words from use as FriendlyId slugs.
#
# With Ruby on Rails, FriendlyId's generator generates an initializer that
# reserves some words such as "new" and "edit" using {FriendlyId.defaults
# FriendlyId.defaults}.
#
# Note that the error messages for fields will appear on the field
# `:friendly_id`. If you are using Rails's scaffolded form errors display, then
# it will have no field to highlight. If you'd like to change this so that
# scaffolding works as expected, one way to accomplish this is to move the error
# message to a different field. For example:
#
#     class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :name, use: :slugged
#
#       after_validation :move_friendly_id_error_to_name
#
#       def move_friendly_id_error_to_name
#         errors.add :name, *errors.delete(:friendly_id) if errors[:friendly_id].present?
#       end
#     end
#
# source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/reserved.rb:32
module FriendlyId::Reserved
  class << self
    # When included, this module adds configuration options to the model class's

  end

  def treat_reserved_as_conflict=(_arg0); end
end

# ## Unique Slugs by Scope
#
# The {FriendlyId::Scoped} module allows FriendlyId to generate unique slugs
# within a scope.
#
# This allows, for example, two restaurants in different cities to have the slug
# `joes-diner`:
#
#     class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       belongs_to :city
#       friendly_id :name, :use => :scoped, :scope => :city
#     end
#
#     class City < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       has_many :restaurants
#       friendly_id :name, :use => :slugged
#     end
#
#     City.friendly.find("seattle").restaurants.friendly.find("joes-diner")
#     City.friendly.find("chicago").restaurants.friendly.find("joes-diner")
#
# Without :scoped in this case, one of the restaurants would have the slug
# `joes-diner` and the other would have `joes-diner-f9f3789a-daec-4156-af1d-fab81aa16ee5`.
#
# The value for the `:scope` option can be the name of a `belongs_to` relation, or
# a column.
#
# Additionally, the `:scope` option can receive an array of scope values:
#
#     class Cuisine < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       has_many :restaurants
#       friendly_id :name, :use => :slugged
#     end
#
#     class City < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       has_many :restaurants
#       friendly_id :name, :use => :slugged
#     end
#
#     class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       belongs_to :city
#       friendly_id :name, :use => :scoped, :scope => [:city, :cuisine]
#     end
#
# All supplied values will be used to determine scope.
#
# ### Finding Records by Friendly ID
#
# If you are using scopes your friendly ids may not be unique, so a simple find
# like:
#
#     Restaurant.friendly.find("joes-diner")
#
# may return the wrong record. In these cases it's best to query through the
# relation:
#
#     @city.restaurants.friendly.find("joes-diner")
#
# Alternatively, you could pass the scope value as a query parameter:
#
#     Restaurant.where(:city_id => @city.id).friendly.find("joes-diner")
#
#
# ### Finding All Records That Match a Scoped ID
#
# Query the slug column directly:
#
#     Restaurant.where(:slug => "joes-diner")
#
# ### Routes for Scoped Models
#
# Recall that FriendlyId is a database-centric library, and does not set up any
# routes for scoped models. You must do this yourself in your application. Here's
# an example of one way to set this up:
#
#     # in routes.rb
#     resources :cities do
#       resources :restaurants
#     end
#
#     # in views
#     <%= link_to 'Show', [@city, @restaurant] %>
#
#     # in controllers
#     @city = City.friendly.find(params[:city_id])
#     @restaurant = @city.restaurants.friendly.find(params[:id])
#
#     # URLs:
#     http://example.org/cities/seattle/restaurants/joes-diner
#     http://example.org/cities/chicago/restaurants/joes-diner

# ## Translating Slugs Using Simple I18n
#
# The {FriendlyId::SimpleI18n SimpleI18n} module adds very basic i18n support to
# FriendlyId.
#
# In order to use this module, your model must have a slug column for each locale.
# By default FriendlyId looks for columns named, for example, "slug_en",
# "slug_es", etc. The first part of the name can be configured by passing the
# `:slug_column` option if you choose. Note that the column for the default locale
# must also include the locale in its name.
#
# This module is most suitable to applications that need to support few locales.
# If you need to support two or more locales, you may wish to use the
# friendly_id_globalize gem instead.
#
# ### Example migration
#
#     def self.up
#       create_table :posts do |t|
#         t.string :title
#         t.string :slug_en
#         t.string :slug_es
#         t.text   :body
#       end
#       add_index :posts, :slug_en
#       add_index :posts, :slug_es
#     end
#
# ### Finds
#
# Finds will take into consideration the current locale:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#     Post.friendly.find("la-guerra-de-las-galaxias")
#     I18n.locale = :en
#     Post.friendly.find("star-wars")
#
# To find a slug by an explicit locale, perform the find inside a block
# passed to I18n's `with_locale` method:
#
#     I18n.with_locale(:es) do
#       Post.friendly.find("la-guerra-de-las-galaxias")
#     end
#
# ### Creating Records
#
# When new records are created, the slug is generated for the current locale only.
#
# ### Translating Slugs
#
# To translate an existing record's friendly_id, use
# {FriendlyId::SimpleI18n::Model#set_friendly_id}. This will ensure that the slug
# you add is properly escaped, transliterated and sequenced:
#
#     post = Post.create :name => "Star Wars"
#     post.set_friendly_id("La guerra de las galaxias", :es)
#
# If you don't pass in a locale argument, FriendlyId::SimpleI18n will just use the
# current locale:
#
#     I18n.with_locale(:es) do
#       post.set_friendly_id("La guerra de las galaxias")
#     end

# ## Slugged Models
#
# FriendlyId can use a separate column to store slugs for models which require
# some text processing.
#
# For example, blog applications typically use a post title to provide the basis
# of a search engine friendly URL. Such identifiers typically lack uppercase
# characters, use ASCII to approximate UTF-8 characters, and strip out other
# characters which may make them aesthetically unappealing or error-prone when
# used in a URL.
#
#     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged
#     end
#
#     @post = Post.create(:title => "This is the first post!")
#     @post.friendly_id   # returns "this-is-the-first-post"
#     redirect_to @post   # the URL will be /posts/this-is-the-first-post
#
# In general, use slugs by default unless you know for sure you don't need them.
# To activate the slugging functionality, use the {FriendlyId::Slugged} module.
#
# FriendlyId will generate slugs from a method or column that you specify, and
# store them in a field in your model. By default, this field must be named
# `:slug`, though you may change this using the
# {FriendlyId::Slugged::Configuration#slug_column slug_column} configuration
# option. You should add an index to this column, and in most cases, make it
# unique. You may also wish to constrain it to NOT NULL, but this depends on your
# app's behavior and requirements.
#
# ### Example Setup
#
#     # your model
#     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged
#       validates_presence_of :title, :slug, :body
#     end
#
#     # a migration
#     class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
#       def self.up
#         create_table :posts do |t|
#           t.string :title, :null => false
#           t.string :slug, :null => false
#           t.text :body
#         end
#
#         add_index :posts, :slug, :unique => true
#       end
#
#       def self.down
#         drop_table :posts
#       end
#     end
#
# ### Working With Slugs
#
# #### Formatting
#
# By default, FriendlyId uses Active Support's
# [parameterize](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-parameterize)
# method to create slugs. This method will intelligently replace spaces with
# dashes, and Unicode Latin characters with ASCII approximations:
#
#     movie = Movie.create! :title => "Der Preis fürs Überleben"
#     movie.slug #=> "der-preis-furs-uberleben"
#
# #### Column or Method?
#
# FriendlyId always uses a method as the basis of the slug text - not a column. At
# first glance, this may sound confusing, but remember that Active Record provides
# methods for each column in a model's associated table, and that's what
# FriendlyId uses.
#
# Here's an example of a class that uses a custom method to generate the slug:
#
#     class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :name_and_location, use: :slugged
#
#       def name_and_location
#         "#{name} from #{location}"
#       end
#     end
#
#     bob = Person.create! :name => "Bob Smith", :location => "New York City"
#     bob.friendly_id #=> "bob-smith-from-new-york-city"
#
# FriendlyId refers to this internally as the "base" method.
#
# #### Uniqueness
#
# When you try to insert a record that would generate a duplicate friendly id,
# FriendlyId will append a UUID to the generated slug to ensure uniqueness:
#
#     car = Car.create :title => "Peugeot 206"
#     car2 = Car.create :title => "Peugeot 206"
#
#     car.friendly_id #=> "peugeot-206"
#     car2.friendly_id #=> "peugeot-206-f9f3789a-daec-4156-af1d-fab81aa16ee5"
#
# Previous versions of FriendlyId appended a numeric sequence to make slugs
# unique, but this was removed to simplify using FriendlyId in concurrent code.
#
# #### Candidates
#
# Since UUIDs are ugly, FriendlyId provides a "slug candidates" functionality to
# let you specify alternate slugs to use in the event the one you want to use is
# already taken. For example:
#
#     class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :slug_candidates, use: :slugged
#
#       # Try building a slug based on the following fields in
#       # increasing order of specificity.
#       def slug_candidates
#         [
#           :name,
#           [:name, :city],
#           [:name, :street, :city],
#           [:name, :street_number, :street, :city]
#         ]
#       end
#     end
#
#     r1 = Restaurant.create! name: 'Plaza Diner', city: 'New Paltz'
#     r2 = Restaurant.create! name: 'Plaza Diner', city: 'Kingston'
#
#     r1.friendly_id  #=> 'plaza-diner'
#     r2.friendly_id  #=> 'plaza-diner-kingston'
#
# To use candidates, make your FriendlyId base method return an array. The
# method need not be named `slug_candidates`; it can be anything you want. The
# array may contain any combination of symbols, strings, procs or lambdas and
# will be evaluated lazily and in order. If you include symbols, FriendlyId will
# invoke a method on your model class with the same name. Strings will be
# interpreted literally. Procs and lambdas will be called and their return values
# used as the basis of the friendly id. If none of the candidates can generate a
# unique slug, then FriendlyId will append a UUID to the first candidate as a
# last resort.
#
# #### Sequence Separator
#
# By default, FriendlyId uses a dash to separate the slug from a sequence.
#
# You can change this with the {FriendlyId::Slugged::Configuration#sequence_separator
# sequence_separator} configuration option.
#
# #### Providing Your Own Slug Processing Method
#
# You can override {FriendlyId::Slugged#normalize_friendly_id} in your model for
# total control over the slug format. It will be invoked for any generated slug,
# whether for a single slug or for slug candidates.
#
# #### Deciding When to Generate New Slugs
#
# As of FriendlyId 5.0, slugs are only generated when the `slug` field is nil. If
# you want a slug to be regenerated,set the slug field to nil:
#
#     restaurant.friendly_id # joes-diner
#     restaurant.name = "The Plaza Diner"
#     restaurant.save!
#     restaurant.friendly_id # joes-diner
#     restaurant.slug = nil
#     restaurant.save!
#     restaurant.friendly_id # the-plaza-diner
#
# You can also override the
# {FriendlyId::Slugged#should_generate_new_friendly_id?} method, which lets you
# control exactly when new friendly ids are set:
#
#     class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :title, :use => :slugged
#
#       def should_generate_new_friendly_id?
#         title_changed?
#       end
#     end
#
# If you want to extend the default behavior but add your own conditions,
# don't forget to invoke `super` from your implementation:
#
#     class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
#       extend FriendlyId
#       friendly_id :name, :use => :slugged
#
#       def should_generate_new_friendly_id?
#         name_changed? || super
#       end
#     end
#
# #### Locale-specific Transliterations
#
# Active Support's `parameterize` uses
# [transliterate](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-transliterate),
# which in turn can use I18n's transliteration rules to consider the current
# locale when replacing Latin characters:
#
#     # config/locales/de.yml
#     de:
#       i18n:
#         transliterate:
#           rule:
#             ü: "ue"
#             ö: "oe"
#             etc...
#
#     movie = Movie.create! :title => "Der Preis fürs Überleben"
#     movie.slug #=> "der-preis-fuers-ueberleben"
#
# This functionality was in fact taken from earlier versions of FriendlyId.
#
# #### Gotchas: Common Problems
#
# FriendlyId uses a before_validation callback to generate and set the slug. This
# means that if you create two model instances before saving them, it's possible
# they will generate the same slug, and the second save will fail.
#
# This can happen in two fairly normal cases: the first, when a model using nested
# attributes creates more than one record for a model that uses friendly_id. The
# second, in concurrent code, either in threads or multiple processes.
#
# To solve the nested attributes issue, I recommend simply avoiding them when
# creating more than one nested record for a model that uses FriendlyId. See [this
# Github issue](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id/issues/185) for discussion.
#
# source://friendly_id-5.4.2/lib/friendly_id/slugged.rb:239
module FriendlyId::Slugged
  # Process the given value to make it suitable for use as a slug.
  #
  # This method is not intended to be invoked directly; FriendlyId uses it
  # internally to process strings into slugs.
  #
  # However, if FriendlyId's default slug generation doesn't suit your needs,
  # you can override this method in your model class to control exactly how
  # slugs are generated.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  #     class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       extend FriendlyId
  #       friendly_id :name_and_location
  #
  #       def name_and_location
  #         "#{name} from #{location}"
  #       end
  #
  #       # Use default slug, but upper case and with underscores
  #       def normalize_friendly_id(string)
  #         super.upcase.gsub("-", "_")
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     bob = Person.create! :name => "Bob Smith", :location => "New York City"
  #     bob.friendly_id #=> "BOB_SMITH_FROM_NEW_YORK_CITY"
