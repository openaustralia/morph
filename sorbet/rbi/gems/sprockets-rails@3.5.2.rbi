# An Engine with the responsibility of coordinating the whole boot process.
#
# == Initialization
#
# Rails::Application is responsible for executing all railties and engines
# initializers. It also executes some bootstrap initializers (check
# Rails::Application::Bootstrap) and finishing initializers, after all the others
# are executed (check Rails::Application::Finisher).
#
# == Configuration
#
# Besides providing the same configuration as Rails::Engine and Rails::Railtie,
# the application object has several specific configurations, for example
# "cache_classes", "consider_all_requests_local", "filter_parameters",
# "logger" and so forth.
#
# Check Rails::Application::Configuration to see them all.
#
# == Routes
#
# The application object is also responsible for holding the routes and reloading routes
# whenever the files change in development.
#
# == Middlewares
#
# The Application is also responsible for building the middleware stack.
#
# == Booting process
#
# The application is also responsible for setting up and executing the booting
# process. From the moment you require "config/application.rb" in your app,
# the booting process goes like this:
#
#   1)  require "config/boot.rb" to set up load paths
#   2)  require railties and engines
#   3)  Define Rails.application as "class MyApp::Application < Rails::Application"
#   4)  Run config.before_configuration callbacks
#   5)  Load config/environments/ENV.rb
#   6)  Run config.before_initialize callbacks
#   7)  Run Railtie#initializer defined by railties, engines and application.
#       One by one, each engine sets up its load paths, routes and runs its config/initializers/* files.
#   8)  Custom Railtie#initializers added by railties, engines and applications are executed
#   9)  Build the middleware stack and run to_prepare callbacks
#   10) Run config.before_eager_load and eager_load! if eager_load is true
#   11) Run config.after_initialize callbacks
#
# == Multiple Applications
#
# If you decide to define multiple applications, then the first application
# that is initialized will be set to +Rails.application+, unless you override
# it with a different application.
#
# To create a new application, you can instantiate a new instance of a class
# that has already been created:
#
#   class Application < Rails::Application
#   end
#
#   first_application  = Application.new
#   second_application = Application.new(config: first_application.config)
#
# In the above example, the configuration from the first application was used
# to initialize the second application. You can also use the +initialize_copy+
# on one of the applications to create a copy of the application which shares
# the configuration.
#
# If you decide to define Rake tasks, runners, or initializers in an
# application other than +Rails.application+, then you must run them manually.
