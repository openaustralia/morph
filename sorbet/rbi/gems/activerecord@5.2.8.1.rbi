# Active Record implements aggregation through a macro-like class method called #composed_of
# for representing attributes as value objects. It expresses relationships like "Account [is]
# composed of Money [among other things]" or "Person [is] composed of [an] address". Each call
# to the macro adds a description of how the value objects are created from the attributes of
# the entity object (when the entity is initialized either as a new object or from finding an
# existing object) and how it can be turned back into attributes (when the entity is saved to
# the database).
#
#   class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
#     composed_of :balance, class_name: "Money", mapping: %w(balance amount)
#     composed_of :address, mapping: [ %w(address_street street), %w(address_city city) ]
#   end
#
# The customer class now has the following methods to manipulate the value objects:
# * <tt>Customer#balance, Customer#balance=(money)</tt>
# * <tt>Customer#address, Customer#address=(address)</tt>
#
# These methods will operate with value objects like the ones described below:
#
#  class Money
#    include Comparable
#    attr_reader :amount, :currency
#    EXCHANGE_RATES = { "USD_TO_DKK" => 6 }
#
#    def initialize(amount, currency = "USD")
#      @amount, @currency = amount, currency
#    end
#
#    def exchange_to(other_currency)
#      exchanged_amount = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATES["#{currency}_TO_#{other_currency}"]).floor
#      Money.new(exchanged_amount, other_currency)
#    end
#
#    def ==(other_money)
#      amount == other_money.amount && currency == other_money.currency
#    end
#
#    def <=>(other_money)
#      if currency == other_money.currency
#        amount <=> other_money.amount
#      else
#        amount <=> other_money.exchange_to(currency).amount
#      end
#    end
#  end
#
#  class Address
#    attr_reader :street, :city
#    def initialize(street, city)
#      @street, @city = street, city
#    end
#
#    def close_to?(other_address)
#      city == other_address.city
#    end
#
#    def ==(other_address)
#      city == other_address.city && street == other_address.street
#    end
#  end
#
# Now it's possible to access attributes from the database through the value objects instead. If
# you choose to name the composition the same as the attribute's name, it will be the only way to
# access that attribute. That's the case with our +balance+ attribute. You interact with the value
# objects just like you would with any other attribute:
#
#   customer.balance = Money.new(20)     # sets the Money value object and the attribute
#   customer.balance                     # => Money value object
#   customer.balance.exchange_to("DKK")  # => Money.new(120, "DKK")
#   customer.balance > Money.new(10)     # => true
#   customer.balance == Money.new(20)    # => true
#   customer.balance < Money.new(5)      # => false
#
# Value objects can also be composed of multiple attributes, such as the case of Address. The order
# of the mappings will determine the order of the parameters.
#
#   customer.address_street = "Hyancintvej"
#   customer.address_city   = "Copenhagen"
#   customer.address        # => Address.new("Hyancintvej", "Copenhagen")
#
#   customer.address = Address.new("May Street", "Chicago")
#   customer.address_street # => "May Street"
#   customer.address_city   # => "Chicago"
#
# == Writing value objects
#
# Value objects are immutable and interchangeable objects that represent a given value, such as
# a Money object representing $5. Two Money objects both representing $5 should be equal (through
# methods such as <tt>==</tt> and <tt><=></tt> from Comparable if ranking makes sense). This is
# unlike entity objects where equality is determined by identity. An entity class such as Customer can
# easily have two different objects that both have an address on Hyancintvej. Entity identity is
# determined by object or relational unique identifiers (such as primary keys). Normal
# ActiveRecord::Base classes are entity objects.
#
# It's also important to treat the value objects as immutable. Don't allow the Money object to have
# its amount changed after creation. Create a new Money object with the new value instead. The
# <tt>Money#exchange_to</tt> method is an example of this. It returns a new value object instead of changing
# its own values. Active Record won't persist value objects that have been changed through means
# other than the writer method.
#
# The immutable requirement is enforced by Active Record by freezing any object assigned as a value
# object. Attempting to change it afterwards will result in a +RuntimeError+.
#
# Read more about value objects on http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ValueObject and on the dangers of not
# keeping value objects immutable on http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ValueObjectsShouldBeImmutable
#
# == Custom constructors and converters
#
# By default value objects are initialized by calling the <tt>new</tt> constructor of the value
# class passing each of the mapped attributes, in the order specified by the <tt>:mapping</tt>
# option, as arguments. If the value class doesn't support this convention then #composed_of allows
# a custom constructor to be specified.
#
# When a new value is assigned to the value object, the default assumption is that the new value
# is an instance of the value class. Specifying a custom converter allows the new value to be automatically
# converted to an instance of value class if necessary.
#
# For example, the +NetworkResource+ model has +network_address+ and +cidr_range+ attributes that should be
# aggregated using the +NetAddr::CIDR+ value class (http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/netaddr/1.5.0/NetAddr/CIDR).
# The constructor for the value class is called +create+ and it expects a CIDR address string as a parameter.
# New values can be assigned to the value object using either another +NetAddr::CIDR+ object, a string
# or an array. The <tt>:constructor</tt> and <tt>:converter</tt> options can be used to meet
# these requirements:
#
#   class NetworkResource < ActiveRecord::Base
#     composed_of :cidr,
#                 class_name: 'NetAddr::CIDR',
#                 mapping: [ %w(network_address network), %w(cidr_range bits) ],
#                 allow_nil: true,
#                 constructor: Proc.new { |network_address, cidr_range| NetAddr::CIDR.create("#{network_address}/#{cidr_range}") },
#                 converter: Proc.new { |value| NetAddr::CIDR.create(value.is_a?(Array) ? value.join('/') : value) }
#   end
#
#   # This calls the :constructor
#   network_resource = NetworkResource.new(network_address: '192.168.0.1', cidr_range: 24)
#
#   # These assignments will both use the :converter
#   network_resource.cidr = [ '192.168.2.1', 8 ]
#   network_resource.cidr = '192.168.0.1/24'
#
#   # This assignment won't use the :converter as the value is already an instance of the value class
#   network_resource.cidr = NetAddr::CIDR.create('192.168.2.1/8')
#
#   # Saving and then reloading will use the :constructor on reload
#   network_resource.save
#   network_resource.reload
#
# == Finding records by a value object
#
# Once a #composed_of relationship is specified for a model, records can be loaded from the database
# by specifying an instance of the value object in the conditions hash. The following example
# finds all customers with +address_street+ equal to "May Street" and +address_city+ equal to "Chicago":
#
#   Customer.where(address: Address.new("May Street", "Chicago"))
#
# source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/aggregations.rb:184
module ActiveRecord::Aggregations::ClassMethods
  # Adds reader and writer methods for manipulating a value object:
  # <tt>composed_of :address</tt> adds <tt>address</tt> and <tt>address=(new_address)</tt> methods.
  #
  # Options are:
  # * <tt>:class_name</tt> - Specifies the class name of the association. Use it only if that name
  #   can't be inferred from the part id. So <tt>composed_of :address</tt> will by default be linked
  #   to the Address class, but if the real class name is +CompanyAddress+, you'll have to specify it
  #   with this option.
  # * <tt>:mapping</tt> - Specifies the mapping of entity attributes to attributes of the value
  #   object. Each mapping is represented as an array where the first item is the name of the
  #   entity attribute and the second item is the name of the attribute in the value object. The
  #   order in which mappings are defined determines the order in which attributes are sent to the
  #   value class constructor.
  # * <tt>:allow_nil</tt> - Specifies that the value object will not be instantiated when all mapped
  #   attributes are +nil+. Setting the value object to +nil+ has the effect of writing +nil+ to all
  #   mapped attributes.
  #   This defaults to +false+.
  # * <tt>:constructor</tt> - A symbol specifying the name of the constructor method or a Proc that
  #   is called to initialize the value object. The constructor is passed all of the mapped attributes,
  #   in the order that they are defined in the <tt>:mapping option</tt>, as arguments and uses them
  #   to instantiate a <tt>:class_name</tt> object.
  #   The default is <tt>:new</tt>.
  # * <tt>:converter</tt> - A symbol specifying the name of a class method of <tt>:class_name</tt>
  #   or a Proc that is called when a new value is assigned to the value object. The converter is
  #   passed the single value that is used in the assignment and is only called if the new value is
  #   not an instance of <tt>:class_name</tt>. If <tt>:allow_nil</tt> is set to true, the converter
  #   can return +nil+ to skip the assignment.
  #
  # Option examples:
  #   composed_of :temperature, mapping: %w(reading celsius)
  #   composed_of :balance, class_name: "Money", mapping: %w(balance amount)
  #   composed_of :address, mapping: [ %w(address_street street), %w(address_city city) ]
  #   composed_of :gps_location
  #   composed_of :gps_location, allow_nil: true
  #   composed_of :ip_address,
  #               class_name: 'IPAddr',
  #               mapping: %w(ip to_i),

# options hash. It works much the same way as Ruby's own <tt>attr*</tt>
# methods.
#
#   class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to              :portfolio
#     has_one                 :project_manager
#     has_many                :milestones
#     has_and_belongs_to_many :categories
#   end
#
# The project class now has the following methods (and more) to ease the traversal and
# manipulation of its relationships:
# * <tt>Project#portfolio, Project#portfolio=(portfolio), Project#portfolio.nil?</tt>
# * <tt>Project#project_manager, Project#project_manager=(project_manager), Project#project_manager.nil?,</tt>
# * <tt>Project#milestones.empty?, Project#milestones.size, Project#milestones, Project#milestones<<(milestone),</tt>
#   <tt>Project#milestones.delete(milestone), Project#milestones.destroy(milestone), Project#milestones.find(milestone_id),</tt>
#   <tt>Project#milestones.build, Project#milestones.create</tt>
# * <tt>Project#categories.empty?, Project#categories.size, Project#categories, Project#categories<<(category1),</tt>
#   <tt>Project#categories.delete(category1), Project#categories.destroy(category1)</tt>
#
# === A word of warning
#
# Don't create associations that have the same name as {instance methods}[rdoc-ref:ActiveRecord::Core] of
# <tt>ActiveRecord::Base</tt>. Since the association adds a method with that name to
# its model, using an association with the same name as one provided by <tt>ActiveRecord::Base</tt> will override the method inherited through <tt>ActiveRecord::Base</tt> and will break things.
# For instance, +attributes+ and +connection+ would be bad choices for association names, because those names already exist in the list of <tt>ActiveRecord::Base</tt> instance methods.
#
# == Auto-generated methods
# See also Instance Public methods below for more details.
#
# === Singular associations (one-to-one)

#
# === Overriding generated methods
#
# Association methods are generated in a module included into the model
# class, making overrides easy. The original generated method can thus be
# called with +super+:
#
#   class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :owner
#     belongs_to :old_owner
#
#     def owner=(new_owner)
#       self.old_owner = self.owner
#       super
#     end
#   end
#
# The association methods module is included immediately after the
# generated attributes methods module, meaning an association will
# override the methods for an attribute with the same name.
#
# == Cardinality and associations
#
# Active Record associations can be used to describe one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many
# relationships between models. Each model uses an association to describe its role in
# the relation. The #belongs_to association is always used in the model that has
# the foreign key.
#
# === One-to-one
#
# Use #has_one in the base, and #belongs_to in the associated model.
#
#   class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_one :office
#   end
#   class Office < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :employee    # foreign key - employee_id
#   end
#
# === One-to-many
#
# Use #has_many in the base, and #belongs_to in the associated model.
#
#   class Manager < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :employees
#   end
#   class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :manager     # foreign key - manager_id
#   end
#
# === Many-to-many
#
# There are two ways to build a many-to-many relationship.
#
# The first way uses a #has_many association with the <tt>:through</tt> option and a join model, so
# there are two stages of associations.
#
#   class Assignment < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :programmer  # foreign key - programmer_id
#     belongs_to :project     # foreign key - project_id
#   end
#   class Programmer < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :assignments
#     has_many :projects, through: :assignments
#   end
#   class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :assignments
#     has_many :programmers, through: :assignments
#   end
#
# For the second way, use #has_and_belongs_to_many in both models. This requires a join table
# that has no corresponding model or primary key.
#
#   class Programmer < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_and_belongs_to_many :projects       # foreign keys in the join table
#   end
#   class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_and_belongs_to_many :programmers    # foreign keys in the join table
#   end
#
# Choosing which way to build a many-to-many relationship is not always simple.
# If you need to work with the relationship model as its own entity,
# use #has_many <tt>:through</tt>. Use #has_and_belongs_to_many when working with legacy schemas or when
# you never work directly with the relationship itself.
#
# == Is it a #belongs_to or #has_one association?
#
# Both express a 1-1 relationship. The difference is mostly where to place the foreign
# key, which goes on the table for the class declaring the #belongs_to relationship.
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # I reference an account.
#     belongs_to :account
#   end
#
#   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # One user references me.
#     has_one :user
#   end
#
# The tables for these classes could look something like:
#
#   CREATE TABLE users (
#     id bigint NOT NULL auto_increment,
#     account_id bigint default NULL,
#     name varchar default NULL,
#     PRIMARY KEY  (id)
#   )
#
#   CREATE TABLE accounts (
#     id bigint NOT NULL auto_increment,
#     name varchar default NULL,
#     PRIMARY KEY  (id)
#   )
#
# == Unsaved objects and associations
#
# You can manipulate objects and associations before they are saved to the database, but
# there is some special behavior you should be aware of, mostly involving the saving of
# associated objects.
#
# You can set the <tt>:autosave</tt> option on a #has_one, #belongs_to,
# #has_many, or #has_and_belongs_to_many association. Setting it
# to +true+ will _always_ save the members, whereas setting it to +false+ will
# _never_ save the members. More details about <tt>:autosave</tt> option is available at
# AutosaveAssociation.
#
# === One-to-one associations
#
# * Assigning an object to a #has_one association automatically saves that object and
#   the object being replaced (if there is one), in order to update their foreign
#   keys - except if the parent object is unsaved (<tt>new_record? == true</tt>).
# * If either of these saves fail (due to one of the objects being invalid), an
#   ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved exception is raised and the assignment is
#   cancelled.
# * If you wish to assign an object to a #has_one association without saving it,
#   use the <tt>#build_association</tt> method (documented below). The object being
#   replaced will still be saved to update its foreign key.
# * Assigning an object to a #belongs_to association does not save the object, since
#   the foreign key field belongs on the parent. It does not save the parent either.
#
# === Collections
#
# * Adding an object to a collection (#has_many or #has_and_belongs_to_many) automatically
#   saves that object, except if the parent object (the owner of the collection) is not yet
#   stored in the database.
# * If saving any of the objects being added to a collection (via <tt>push</tt> or similar)
#   fails, then <tt>push</tt> returns +false+.
# * If saving fails while replacing the collection (via <tt>association=</tt>), an
#   ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved exception is raised and the assignment is
#   cancelled.
# * You can add an object to a collection without automatically saving it by using the
#   <tt>collection.build</tt> method (documented below).
# * All unsaved (<tt>new_record? == true</tt>) members of the collection are automatically
#   saved when the parent is saved.
#
# == Customizing the query
#
# \Associations are built from <tt>Relation</tt> objects, and you can use the Relation syntax
# to customize them. For example, to add a condition:
#
#   class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :published_posts, -> { where(published: true) }, class_name: 'Post'
#   end
#
# Inside the <tt>-> { ... }</tt> block you can use all of the usual Relation methods.
#
# === Accessing the owner object
#
# Sometimes it is useful to have access to the owner object when building the query. The owner
# is passed as a parameter to the block. For example, the following association would find all
# events that occur on the user's birthday:
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :birthday_events, ->(user) { where(starts_on: user.birthday) }, class_name: 'Event'
#   end
#
# Note: Joining, eager loading and preloading of these associations is not possible.
# These operations happen before instance creation and the scope will be called with a +nil+ argument.
#
# == Association callbacks
#
# Similar to the normal callbacks that hook into the life cycle of an Active Record object,
# you can also define callbacks that get triggered when you add an object to or remove an
# object from an association collection.
#
#   class Project
#     has_and_belongs_to_many :developers, after_add: :evaluate_velocity
#
#     def evaluate_velocity(developer)
#       ...
#     end
#   end
#
# It's possible to stack callbacks by passing them as an array. Example:
#
#   class Project
#     has_and_belongs_to_many :developers,
#                             after_add: [:evaluate_velocity, Proc.new { |p, d| p.shipping_date = Time.now}]
#   end
#
# Possible callbacks are: +before_add+, +after_add+, +before_remove+ and +after_remove+.
#
# If any of the +before_add+ callbacks throw an exception, the object will not be
# added to the collection.
#
# Similarly, if any of the +before_remove+ callbacks throw an exception, the object
# will not be removed from the collection.
#
# == Association extensions
#
# The proxy objects that control the access to associations can be extended through anonymous
# modules. This is especially beneficial for adding new finders, creators, and other
# factory-type methods that are only used as part of this association.
#
#   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :people do
#       def find_or_create_by_name(name)
#         first_name, last_name = name.split(" ", 2)
#         find_or_create_by(first_name: first_name, last_name: last_name)
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
#   person = Account.first.people.find_or_create_by_name("David Heinemeier Hansson")
#   person.first_name # => "David"
#   person.last_name  # => "Heinemeier Hansson"
#
# If you need to share the same extensions between many associations, you can use a named
# extension module.
#
#   module FindOrCreateByNameExtension
#     def find_or_create_by_name(name)
#       first_name, last_name = name.split(" ", 2)
#       find_or_create_by(first_name: first_name, last_name: last_name)
#     end
#   end
#
#   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :people, -> { extending FindOrCreateByNameExtension }
#   end
#
#   class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :people, -> { extending FindOrCreateByNameExtension }
#   end
#
# Some extensions can only be made to work with knowledge of the association's internals.
# Extensions can access relevant state using the following methods (where +items+ is the
# name of the association):
#
# * <tt>record.association(:items).owner</tt> - Returns the object the association is part of.
# * <tt>record.association(:items).reflection</tt> - Returns the reflection object that describes the association.
# * <tt>record.association(:items).target</tt> - Returns the associated object for #belongs_to and #has_one, or
#   the collection of associated objects for #has_many and #has_and_belongs_to_many.
#
# However, inside the actual extension code, you will not have access to the <tt>record</tt> as
# above. In this case, you can access <tt>proxy_association</tt>. For example,
# <tt>record.association(:items)</tt> and <tt>record.items.proxy_association</tt> will return
# the same object, allowing you to make calls like <tt>proxy_association.owner</tt> inside
# association extensions.
#
# == Association Join Models
#
# Has Many associations can be configured with the <tt>:through</tt> option to use an
# explicit join model to retrieve the data. This operates similarly to a
# #has_and_belongs_to_many association. The advantage is that you're able to add validations,
# callbacks, and extra attributes on the join model. Consider the following schema:
#
#   class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :authorships
#     has_many :books, through: :authorships
#   end
#
#   class Authorship < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :author
#     belongs_to :book
#   end
#
#   @author = Author.first
#   @author.authorships.collect { |a| a.book } # selects all books that the author's authorships belong to
#   @author.books                              # selects all books by using the Authorship join model
#
# You can also go through a #has_many association on the join model:
#
#   class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many   :clients
#     has_many   :invoices, through: :clients
#   end
#
#   class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :firm
#     has_many   :invoices
#   end
#
#   class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :client
#   end
#
#   @firm = Firm.first
#   @firm.clients.flat_map { |c| c.invoices } # select all invoices for all clients of the firm
#   @firm.invoices                            # selects all invoices by going through the Client join model
#
# Similarly you can go through a #has_one association on the join model:
#
#   class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many   :users
#     has_many   :avatars, through: :users
#   end
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :group
#     has_one    :avatar
#   end
#
#   class Avatar < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :user
#   end
#
#   @group = Group.first
#   @group.users.collect { |u| u.avatar }.compact # select all avatars for all users in the group
#   @group.avatars                                # selects all avatars by going through the User join model.
#
# An important caveat with going through #has_one or #has_many associations on the
# join model is that these associations are *read-only*. For example, the following
# would not work following the previous example:
#
#   @group.avatars << Avatar.new   # this would work if User belonged_to Avatar rather than the other way around
#   @group.avatars.delete(@group.avatars.last)  # so would this
#
# == Setting Inverses
#
# If you are using a #belongs_to on the join model, it is a good idea to set the
# <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option on the #belongs_to, which will mean that the following example
# works correctly (where <tt>tags</tt> is a #has_many <tt>:through</tt> association):
#
#   @post = Post.first
#   @tag = @post.tags.build name: "ruby"
#   @tag.save
#
# The last line ought to save the through record (a <tt>Tagging</tt>). This will only work if the
# <tt>:inverse_of</tt> is set:
#
#   class Tagging < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :post
#     belongs_to :tag, inverse_of: :taggings
#   end
#
# If you do not set the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> record, the association will
# do its best to match itself up with the correct inverse. Automatic
# inverse detection only works on #has_many, #has_one, and
# #belongs_to associations.
#
# Extra options on the associations, as defined in the
# <tt>AssociationReflection::INVALID_AUTOMATIC_INVERSE_OPTIONS</tt> constant, will
# also prevent the association's inverse from being found automatically.
#
# The automatic guessing of the inverse association uses a heuristic based
# on the name of the class, so it may not work for all associations,
# especially the ones with non-standard names.
#
# You can turn off the automatic detection of inverse associations by setting
# the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option to <tt>false</tt> like so:
#
#   class Tagging < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :tag, inverse_of: false
#   end
#
# == Nested \Associations
#
# You can actually specify *any* association with the <tt>:through</tt> option, including an
# association which has a <tt>:through</tt> option itself. For example:
#
#   class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts
#     has_many :comments, through: :posts
#     has_many :commenters, through: :comments
#   end
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :comments
#   end
#
#   class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :commenter
#   end
#
#   @author = Author.first
#   @author.commenters # => People who commented on posts written by the author
#
# An equivalent way of setting up this association this would be:
#
#   class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts
#     has_many :commenters, through: :posts
#   end
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :comments
#     has_many :commenters, through: :comments
#   end
#
#   class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :commenter
#   end
#
# When using a nested association, you will not be able to modify the association because there
# is not enough information to know what modification to make. For example, if you tried to
# add a <tt>Commenter</tt> in the example above, there would be no way to tell how to set up the
# intermediate <tt>Post</tt> and <tt>Comment</tt> objects.
#
# == Polymorphic \Associations
#
# Polymorphic associations on models are not restricted on what types of models they
# can be associated with. Rather, they specify an interface that a #has_many association
# must adhere to.
#
#   class Asset < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :attachable, polymorphic: true
#   end
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :assets, as: :attachable         # The :as option specifies the polymorphic interface to use.
#   end
#
#   @asset.attachable = @post
#
# This works by using a type column in addition to a foreign key to specify the associated
# record. In the Asset example, you'd need an +attachable_id+ integer column and an
# +attachable_type+ string column.
#
# Using polymorphic associations in combination with single table inheritance (STI) is
# a little tricky. In order for the associations to work as expected, ensure that you
# store the base model for the STI models in the type column of the polymorphic
# association. To continue with the asset example above, suppose there are guest posts
# and member posts that use the posts table for STI. In this case, there must be a +type+
# column in the posts table.
#
# Note: The <tt>attachable_type=</tt> method is being called when assigning an +attachable+.
# The +class_name+ of the +attachable+ is passed as a String.
#
#   class Asset < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :attachable, polymorphic: true
#
#     def attachable_type=(class_name)
#        super(class_name.constantize.base_class.to_s)
#     end
#   end
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # because we store "Post" in attachable_type now dependent: :destroy will work
#     has_many :assets, as: :attachable, dependent: :destroy
#   end
#
#   class GuestPost < Post
#   end
#
#   class MemberPost < Post
#   end
#
# == Caching
#
# All of the methods are built on a simple caching principle that will keep the result
# of the last query around unless specifically instructed not to. The cache is even
# shared across methods to make it even cheaper to use the macro-added methods without
# worrying too much about performance at the first go.
#
#   project.milestones             # fetches milestones from the database
#   project.milestones.size        # uses the milestone cache
#   project.milestones.empty?      # uses the milestone cache
#   project.milestones.reload.size # fetches milestones from the database
#   project.milestones             # uses the milestone cache
#
# == Eager loading of associations
#
# Eager loading is a way to find objects of a certain class and a number of named associations.
# It is one of the easiest ways to prevent the dreaded N+1 problem in which fetching 100
# posts that each need to display their author triggers 101 database queries. Through the
# use of eager loading, the number of queries will be reduced from 101 to 2.
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :author
#     has_many   :comments
#   end
#
# Consider the following loop using the class above:
#
#   Post.all.each do |post|
#     puts "Post:            " + post.title
#     puts "Written by:      " + post.author.name
#     puts "Last comment on: " + post.comments.first.created_on
#   end
#
# To iterate over these one hundred posts, we'll generate 201 database queries. Let's
# first just optimize it for retrieving the author:
#
#   Post.includes(:author).each do |post|
#
# This references the name of the #belongs_to association that also used the <tt>:author</tt>
# symbol. After loading the posts, +find+ will collect the +author_id+ from each one and load
# all of the referenced authors with one query. Doing so will cut down the number of queries
# from 201 to 102.
#
# We can improve upon the situation further by referencing both associations in the finder with:
#
#   Post.includes(:author, :comments).each do |post|
#
# This will load all comments with a single query. This reduces the total number of queries
# to 3. In general, the number of queries will be 1 plus the number of associations
# named (except if some of the associations are polymorphic #belongs_to - see below).
#
# To include a deep hierarchy of associations, use a hash:
#
#   Post.includes(:author, { comments: { author: :gravatar } }).each do |post|
#
# The above code will load all the comments and all of their associated
# authors and gravatars. You can mix and match any combination of symbols,
# arrays, and hashes to retrieve the associations you want to load.
#
# All of this power shouldn't fool you into thinking that you can pull out huge amounts
# of data with no performance penalty just because you've reduced the number of queries.
# The database still needs to send all the data to Active Record and it still needs to
# be processed. So it's no catch-all for performance problems, but it's a great way to
# cut down on the number of queries in a situation as the one described above.
#
# Since only one table is loaded at a time, conditions or orders cannot reference tables
# other than the main one. If this is the case, Active Record falls back to the previously
# used <tt>LEFT OUTER JOIN</tt> based strategy. For example:
#
#   Post.includes([:author, :comments]).where(['comments.approved = ?', true])
#
# This will result in a single SQL query with joins along the lines of:
# <tt>LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id</tt> and
# <tt>LEFT OUTER JOIN authors ON authors.id = posts.author_id</tt>. Note that using conditions
# like this can have unintended consequences.
# In the above example, posts with no approved comments are not returned at all because
# the conditions apply to the SQL statement as a whole and not just to the association.
#
# You must disambiguate column references for this fallback to happen, for example
# <tt>order: "author.name DESC"</tt> will work but <tt>order: "name DESC"</tt> will not.
#
# If you want to load all posts (including posts with no approved comments), then write
# your own <tt>LEFT OUTER JOIN</tt> query using <tt>ON</tt>:
#
#   Post.joins("LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id AND comments.approved = '1'")
#
# In this case, it is usually more natural to include an association which has conditions defined on it:
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :approved_comments, -> { where(approved: true) }, class_name: 'Comment'
#   end
#
#   Post.includes(:approved_comments)
#
# This will load posts and eager load the +approved_comments+ association, which contains
# only those comments that have been approved.
#
# If you eager load an association with a specified <tt>:limit</tt> option, it will be ignored,
# returning all the associated objects:
#
#   class Picture < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :most_recent_comments, -> { order('id DESC').limit(10) }, class_name: 'Comment'
#   end
#
#   Picture.includes(:most_recent_comments).first.most_recent_comments # => returns all associated comments.
#
# Eager loading is supported with polymorphic associations.
#
#   class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :addressable, polymorphic: true
#   end
#
# A call that tries to eager load the addressable model
#
#   Address.includes(:addressable)
#
# This will execute one query to load the addresses and load the addressables with one
# query per addressable type.
# For example, if all the addressables are either of class Person or Company, then a total
# of 3 queries will be executed. The list of addressable types to load is determined on
# the back of the addresses loaded. This is not supported if Active Record has to fallback
# to the previous implementation of eager loading and will raise ActiveRecord::EagerLoadPolymorphicError.
# The reason is that the parent model's type is a column value so its corresponding table
# name cannot be put in the +FROM+/+JOIN+ clauses of that query.
#
# == Table Aliasing
#
# Active Record uses table aliasing in the case that a table is referenced multiple times
# in a join. If a table is referenced only once, the standard table name is used. The
# second time, the table is aliased as <tt>#{reflection_name}_#{parent_table_name}</tt>.
# Indexes are appended for any more successive uses of the table name.
#
#   Post.joins(:comments)
#   # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ...
#   Post.joins(:special_comments) # STI
#   # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ... AND comments.type = 'SpecialComment'
#   Post.joins(:comments, :special_comments) # special_comments is the reflection name, posts is the parent table name
#   # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ... INNER JOIN comments special_comments_posts
#
# Acts as tree example:
#
#   TreeMixin.joins(:children)
#   # => SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
#   TreeMixin.joins(children: :parent)
#   # => SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
#                               INNER JOIN parents_mixins ...
#   TreeMixin.joins(children: {parent: :children})
#   # => SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
#                               INNER JOIN parents_mixins ...
#                               INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins_2
#
# Has and Belongs to Many join tables use the same idea, but add a <tt>_join</tt> suffix:
#
#   Post.joins(:categories)
#   # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
#   Post.joins(categories: :posts)
#   # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
#                              INNER JOIN categories_posts posts_categories_join INNER JOIN posts posts_categories
#   Post.joins(categories: {posts: :categories})
#   # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
#                              INNER JOIN categories_posts posts_categories_join INNER JOIN posts posts_categories
#                              INNER JOIN categories_posts categories_posts_join INNER JOIN categories categories_posts_2
#
# If you wish to specify your own custom joins using ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#joins method, those table
# names will take precedence over the eager associations:
#
#   Post.joins(:comments).joins("inner join comments ...")
#   # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments_posts ON ... INNER JOIN comments ...
#   Post.joins(:comments, :special_comments).joins("inner join comments ...")
#   # => SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments comments_posts ON ...
#                              INNER JOIN comments special_comments_posts ...
#                              INNER JOIN comments ...
#
# Table aliases are automatically truncated according to the maximum length of table identifiers
# according to the specific database.
#
# == Modules
#
# By default, associations will look for objects within the current module scope. Consider:
#
#   module MyApplication
#     module Business
#       class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base
#         has_many :clients
#       end
#
#       class Client < ActiveRecord::Base; end
#     end
#   end
#
# When <tt>Firm#clients</tt> is called, it will in turn call
# <tt>MyApplication::Business::Client.find_all_by_firm_id(firm.id)</tt>.
# If you want to associate with a class in another module scope, this can be done by
# specifying the complete class name.
#
#   module MyApplication
#     module Business
#       class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base; end
#     end
#
#     module Billing
#       class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
#         belongs_to :firm, class_name: "MyApplication::Business::Firm"
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
# == Bi-directional associations
#
# When you specify an association, there is usually an association on the associated model
# that specifies the same relationship in reverse. For example, with the following models:
#
#    class Dungeon < ActiveRecord::Base
#      has_many :traps
#      has_one :evil_wizard
#    end
#
#    class Trap < ActiveRecord::Base
#      belongs_to :dungeon
#    end
#
#    class EvilWizard < ActiveRecord::Base
#      belongs_to :dungeon
#    end
#
# The +traps+ association on +Dungeon+ and the +dungeon+ association on +Trap+ are
# the inverse of each other, and the inverse of the +dungeon+ association on +EvilWizard+
# is the +evil_wizard+ association on +Dungeon+ (and vice-versa). By default,
# Active Record can guess the inverse of the association based on the name
# of the class. The result is the following:
#
#    d = Dungeon.first
#    t = d.traps.first
#    d.object_id == t.dungeon.object_id # => true
#
# The +Dungeon+ instances +d+ and <tt>t.dungeon</tt> in the above example refer to
# the same in-memory instance since the association matches the name of the class.
# The result would be the same if we added +:inverse_of+ to our model definitions:
#
#    class Dungeon < ActiveRecord::Base
#      has_many :traps, inverse_of: :dungeon
#      has_one :evil_wizard, inverse_of: :dungeon
#    end
#
#    class Trap < ActiveRecord::Base
#      belongs_to :dungeon, inverse_of: :traps
#    end
#
#    class EvilWizard < ActiveRecord::Base
#      belongs_to :dungeon, inverse_of: :evil_wizard
#    end
#
# For more information, see the documentation for the +:inverse_of+ option.
#
# == Deleting from associations
#
# === Dependent associations
#
# #has_many, #has_one, and #belongs_to associations support the <tt>:dependent</tt> option.
# This allows you to specify that associated records should be deleted when the owner is
# deleted.
#
# For example:
#
#     class Author
#       has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy
#     end
#     Author.find(1).destroy # => Will destroy all of the author's posts, too
#
# The <tt>:dependent</tt> option can have different values which specify how the deletion
# is done. For more information, see the documentation for this option on the different
# specific association types. When no option is given, the behavior is to do nothing
# with the associated records when destroying a record.
#
# Note that <tt>:dependent</tt> is implemented using Rails' callback
# system, which works by processing callbacks in order. Therefore, other
# callbacks declared either before or after the <tt>:dependent</tt> option
# can affect what it does.
#
# Note that <tt>:dependent</tt> option is ignored for #has_one <tt>:through</tt> associations.
#
# === Delete or destroy?
#
# #has_many and #has_and_belongs_to_many associations have the methods <tt>destroy</tt>,
# <tt>delete</tt>, <tt>destroy_all</tt> and <tt>delete_all</tt>.
#
# For #has_and_belongs_to_many, <tt>delete</tt> and <tt>destroy</tt> are the same: they
# cause the records in the join table to be removed.
#
# For #has_many, <tt>destroy</tt> and <tt>destroy_all</tt> will always call the <tt>destroy</tt> method of the
# record(s) being removed so that callbacks are run. However <tt>delete</tt> and <tt>delete_all</tt> will either
# do the deletion according to the strategy specified by the <tt>:dependent</tt> option, or
# if no <tt>:dependent</tt> option is given, then it will follow the default strategy.
# The default strategy is to do nothing (leave the foreign keys with the parent ids set), except for
# #has_many <tt>:through</tt>, where the default strategy is <tt>delete_all</tt> (delete
# the join records, without running their callbacks).
#
# There is also a <tt>clear</tt> method which is the same as <tt>delete_all</tt>, except that
# it returns the association rather than the records which have been deleted.
#
# === What gets deleted?
#
# There is a potential pitfall here: #has_and_belongs_to_many and #has_many <tt>:through</tt>
# associations have records in join tables, as well as the associated records. So when we
# call one of these deletion methods, what exactly should be deleted?
#
# The answer is that it is assumed that deletion on an association is about removing the
# <i>link</i> between the owner and the associated object(s), rather than necessarily the
# associated objects themselves. So with #has_and_belongs_to_many and #has_many
# <tt>:through</tt>, the join records will be deleted, but the associated records won't.
#
# This makes sense if you think about it: if you were to call <tt>post.tags.delete(Tag.find_by(name: 'food'))</tt>
# you would want the 'food' tag to be unlinked from the post, rather than for the tag itself
# to be removed from the database.
#
# However, there are examples where this strategy doesn't make sense. For example, suppose
# a person has many projects, and each project has many tasks. If we deleted one of a person's
# tasks, we would probably not want the project to be deleted. In this scenario, the delete method
# won't actually work: it can only be used if the association on the join model is a
# #belongs_to. In other situations you are expected to perform operations directly on
# either the associated records or the <tt>:through</tt> association.
#
# With a regular #has_many there is no distinction between the "associated records"
# and the "link", so there is only one choice for what gets deleted.
#
# With #has_and_belongs_to_many and #has_many <tt>:through</tt>, if you want to delete the
# associated records themselves, you can always do something along the lines of
# <tt>person.tasks.each(&:destroy)</tt>.
#
# == Type safety with ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch
#
# If you attempt to assign an object to an association that doesn't match the inferred
# or specified <tt>:class_name</tt>, you'll get an ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch.
#
# == Options
#
# All of the association macros can be specialized through options. This makes cases
# more complex than the simple and guessable ones possible.
#
# source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/associations.rb:1150
module ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods
  # Specifies a one-to-one association with another class. This method should only be used
  # if this class contains the foreign key. If the other class contains the foreign key,
  # then you should use #has_one instead. See also ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview
  # on when to use #has_one and when to use #belongs_to.
  #
  # Methods will be added for retrieval and query for a single associated object, for which
  # this object holds an id:
  #
  # +association+ is a placeholder for the symbol passed as the +name+ argument, so
  # <tt>belongs_to :author</tt> would add among others <tt>author.nil?</tt>.
  #
  # [association]
  #   Returns the associated object. +nil+ is returned if none is found.
  # [association=(associate)]
  #   Assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, and sets it as the foreign key.
  # [build_association(attributes = {})]
  #   Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated
  #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through a foreign key, but has not yet been saved.
  # [create_association(attributes = {})]
  #   Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated
  #   with +attributes+, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that
  #   has already been saved (if it passed the validation).
  # [create_association!(attributes = {})]
  #   Does the same as <tt>create_association</tt>, but raises ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
  #   if the record is invalid.
  # [reload_association]
  #   Returns the associated object, forcing a database read.
  #
  # === Example
  #
  # A Post class declares <tt>belongs_to :author</tt>, which will add:
  # * <tt>Post#author</tt> (similar to <tt>Author.find(author_id)</tt>)
  # * <tt>Post#author=(author)</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author_id = author.id</tt>)
  # * <tt>Post#build_author</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new</tt>)
  # * <tt>Post#create_author</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new; post.author.save; post.author</tt>)
  # * <tt>Post#create_author!</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author = Author.new; post.author.save!; post.author</tt>)
  # * <tt>Post#reload_author</tt>
  # The declaration can also include an +options+ hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
  #
  # === Scopes
  #
  # You can pass a second argument +scope+ as a callable (i.e. proc or
  # lambda) to retrieve a specific record or customize the generated query
  # when you access the associated object.
  #
  # Scope examples:
  #   belongs_to :firm, -> { where(id: 2) }
  #   belongs_to :user, -> { joins(:friends) }
  #   belongs_to :level, ->(game) { where("game_level > ?", game.current_level) }
  #
  # === Options
  #
  # [:class_name]
  #   Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
  #   from the association name. So <tt>belongs_to :author</tt> will by default be linked to the Author class, but
  #   if the real class name is Person, you'll have to specify it with this option.
  # [:foreign_key]
  #   Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
  #   of the association with an "_id" suffix. So a class that defines a <tt>belongs_to :person</tt>
  #   association will use "person_id" as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>. Similarly,
  #   <tt>belongs_to :favorite_person, class_name: "Person"</tt> will use a foreign key
  #   of "favorite_person_id".
  #
  #   If you are going to modify the association (rather than just read from it), then it is
  #   a good idea to set the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option.
  # [:foreign_type]
  #   Specify the column used to store the associated object's type, if this is a polymorphic
  #   association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the association with a "_type"
  #   suffix. So a class that defines a <tt>belongs_to :taggable, polymorphic: true</tt>
  #   association will use "taggable_type" as the default <tt>:foreign_type</tt>.
  # [:primary_key]
  #   Specify the method that returns the primary key of associated object used for the association.
  #   By default this is id.
  # [:dependent]
  #   If set to <tt>:destroy</tt>, the associated object is destroyed when this object is. If set to
  #   <tt>:delete</tt>, the associated object is deleted *without* calling its destroy method.
  #   This option should not be specified when #belongs_to is used in conjunction with
  #   a #has_many relationship on another class because of the potential to leave
  #   orphaned records behind.
  # [:counter_cache]
  #   Caches the number of belonging objects on the associate class through the use of CounterCache::ClassMethods#increment_counter
  #   and CounterCache::ClassMethods#decrement_counter. The counter cache is incremented when an object of this
  #   class is created and decremented when it's destroyed. This requires that a column
  #   named <tt>#{table_name}_count</tt> (such as +comments_count+ for a belonging Comment class)
  #   is used on the associate class (such as a Post class) - that is the migration for
  #   <tt>#{table_name}_count</tt> is created on the associate class (such that <tt>Post.comments_count</tt> will
  #   return the count cached, see note below). You can also specify a custom counter
  #   cache column by providing a column name instead of a +true+/+false+ value to this
  #   option (e.g., <tt>counter_cache: :my_custom_counter</tt>.)
  #   Note: Specifying a counter cache will add it to that model's list of readonly attributes
  #   using +attr_readonly+.
  # [:polymorphic]
  #   Specify this association is a polymorphic association by passing +true+.
  #   Note: If you've enabled the counter cache, then you may want to add the counter cache attribute
  #   to the +attr_readonly+ list in the associated classes (e.g. <tt>class Post; attr_readonly :comments_count; end</tt>).
  # [:validate]
  #   When set to +true+, validates new objects added to association when saving the parent object. +false+ by default.
  #   If you want to ensure associated objects are revalidated on every update, use +validates_associated+.
  # [:autosave]
  #   If true, always save the associated object or destroy it if marked for destruction, when
  #   saving the parent object.
  #   If false, never save or destroy the associated object.
  #   By default, only save the associated object if it's a new record.
  #
  #   Note that NestedAttributes::ClassMethods#accepts_nested_attributes_for
  #   sets <tt>:autosave</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
  # [:touch]
  #   If true, the associated object will be touched (the updated_at/on attributes set to current time)
  #   when this record is either saved or destroyed. If you specify a symbol, that attribute
  #   will be updated with the current time in addition to the updated_at/on attribute.
  #   Please note that with touching no validation is performed and only the +after_touch+,
  #   +after_commit+ and +after_rollback+ callbacks are executed.
  # [:inverse_of]
  #   Specifies the name of the #has_one or #has_many association on the associated
  #   object that is the inverse of this #belongs_to association.
  #   See ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on Bi-directional associations for more detail.
  # [:optional]
  #   When set to +true+, the association will not have its presence validated.
  # [:required]
  #   When set to +true+, the association will also have its presence validated.
  #   This will validate the association itself, not the id. You can use
  #   +:inverse_of+ to avoid an extra query during validation.
  #   NOTE: <tt>required</tt> is set to <tt>true</tt> by default and is deprecated. If
  #   you don't want to have association presence validated, use <tt>optional: true</tt>.
  # [:default]
  #   Provide a callable (i.e. proc or lambda) to specify that the association should
  #   be initialized with a particular record before validation.
  #
  # Option examples:
  #   belongs_to :firm, foreign_key: "client_of"
  #   belongs_to :person, primary_key: "name", foreign_key: "person_name"
  #   belongs_to :author, class_name: "Person", foreign_key: "author_id"
  #   belongs_to :valid_coupon, ->(o) { where "discounts > ?", o.payments_count },
  #                             class_name: "Coupon", foreign_key: "coupon_id"
  #   belongs_to :attachable, polymorphic: true
  #   belongs_to :project, -> { readonly }
  #   belongs_to :post, counter_cache: true
  #   belongs_to :comment, touch: true
  #   belongs_to :company, touch: :employees_last_updated_at
  #   belongs_to :user, optional: true
  #   belongs_to :account, default: -> { company.account }
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/associations.rb:1653
  def belongs_to(name, scope = T.unsafe(nil), **options); end

  # Specifies a many-to-many relationship with another class. This associates two classes via an
  # intermediate join table. Unless the join table is explicitly specified as an option, it is
  # guessed using the lexical order of the class names. So a join between Developer and Project
  # will give the default join table name of "developers_projects" because "D" precedes "P" alphabetically.
  # Note that this precedence is calculated using the <tt><</tt> operator for String. This
  # means that if the strings are of different lengths, and the strings are equal when compared
  # up to the shortest length, then the longer string is considered of higher
  # lexical precedence than the shorter one. For example, one would expect the tables "paper_boxes" and "papers"
  # to generate a join table name of "papers_paper_boxes" because of the length of the name "paper_boxes",
  # but it in fact generates a join table name of "paper_boxes_papers". Be aware of this caveat, and use the
  # custom <tt>:join_table</tt> option if you need to.
  # If your tables share a common prefix, it will only appear once at the beginning. For example,
  # the tables "catalog_categories" and "catalog_products" generate a join table name of "catalog_categories_products".
  #
  # The join table should not have a primary key or a model associated with it. You must manually generate the
  # join table with a migration such as this:
  #
  #   class CreateDevelopersProjectsJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  #     def change
  #       create_join_table :developers, :projects
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # It's also a good idea to add indexes to each of those columns to speed up the joins process.
  # However, in MySQL it is advised to add a compound index for both of the columns as MySQL only
  # uses one index per table during the lookup.
  #
  # Adds the following methods for retrieval and query:
  #
  # +collection+ is a placeholder for the symbol passed as the +name+ argument, so
  # <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :categories</tt> would add among others <tt>categories.empty?</tt>.
  #
  # [collection]
  #   Returns a Relation of all the associated objects.
  #   An empty Relation is returned if none are found.
  # [collection<<(object, ...)]
  #   Adds one or more objects to the collection by creating associations in the join table
  #   (<tt>collection.push</tt> and <tt>collection.concat</tt> are aliases to this method).
  #   Note that this operation instantly fires update SQL without waiting for the save or update call on the
  #   parent object, unless the parent object is a new record.
  # [collection.delete(object, ...)]
  #   Removes one or more objects from the collection by removing their associations from the join table.
  #   This does not destroy the objects.
  # [collection.destroy(object, ...)]
  #   Removes one or more objects from the collection by running destroy on each association in the join table, overriding any dependent option.
  #   This does not destroy the objects.
  # [collection=objects]
  #   Replaces the collection's content by deleting and adding objects as appropriate.
  # [collection_singular_ids]
  #   Returns an array of the associated objects' ids.
  # [collection_singular_ids=ids]
  #   Replace the collection by the objects identified by the primary keys in +ids+.
  # [collection.clear]
  #   Removes every object from the collection. This does not destroy the objects.
  # [collection.empty?]
  #   Returns +true+ if there are no associated objects.
  # [collection.size]
  #   Returns the number of associated objects.
  # [collection.find(id)]
  #   Finds an associated object responding to the +id+ and that
  #   meets the condition that it has to be associated with this object.
  #   Uses the same rules as ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#find.
  # [collection.exists?(...)]
  #   Checks whether an associated object with the given conditions exists.
  #   Uses the same rules as ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#exists?.
  # [collection.build(attributes = {})]
  #   Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated
  #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through the join table, but has not yet been saved.
  # [collection.create(attributes = {})]
  #   Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated
  #   with +attributes+, linked to this object through the join table, and that has already been
  #   saved (if it passed the validation).
  # [collection.reload]
  #   Returns a Relation of all of the associated objects, forcing a database read.
  #   An empty Relation is returned if none are found.
  #
  # === Example
  #
  # A Developer class declares <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :projects</tt>, which will add:
  # * <tt>Developer#projects</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects<<</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.delete</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.destroy</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects=</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#project_ids</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#project_ids=</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.clear</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.empty?</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.size</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.find(id)</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.exists?(...)</tt>
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.build</tt> (similar to <tt>Project.new(developer_id: id)</tt>)
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.create</tt> (similar to <tt>c = Project.new(developer_id: id); c.save; c</tt>)
  # * <tt>Developer#projects.reload</tt>
  # The declaration may include an +options+ hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
  #
  # === Scopes
  #
  # You can pass a second argument +scope+ as a callable (i.e. proc or
  # lambda) to retrieve a specific set of records or customize the generated
  # query when you access the associated collection.
  #
  # Scope examples:
  #   has_and_belongs_to_many :projects, -> { includes(:milestones, :manager) }
  #   has_and_belongs_to_many :categories, ->(post) {
  #     where("default_category = ?", post.default_category)
  #
  # === Extensions
  #
  # The +extension+ argument allows you to pass a block into a
  # has_and_belongs_to_many association. This is useful for adding new
  # finders, creators and other factory-type methods to be used as part of
  # the association.
  #
  # Extension examples:
  #   has_and_belongs_to_many :contractors do
  #     def find_or_create_by_name(name)
  #       first_name, last_name = name.split(" ", 2)
  #       find_or_create_by(first_name: first_name, last_name: last_name)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # === Options
  #
  # [:class_name]
  #   Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
  #   from the association name. So <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :projects</tt> will by default be linked to the
  #   Project class, but if the real class name is SuperProject, you'll have to specify it with this option.
  # [:join_table]
  #   Specify the name of the join table if the default based on lexical order isn't what you want.
  #   <b>WARNING:</b> If you're overwriting the table name of either class, the +table_name+ method
  #   MUST be declared underneath any #has_and_belongs_to_many declaration in order to work.
  # [:foreign_key]
  #   Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
  #   of this class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So a Person class that makes
  #   a #has_and_belongs_to_many association to Project will use "person_id" as the
  #   default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>.
  #
  #   If you are going to modify the association (rather than just read from it), then it is
  #   a good idea to set the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option.
  # [:association_foreign_key]
  #   Specify the foreign key used for the association on the receiving side of the association.
  #   By default this is guessed to be the name of the associated class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed.
  #   So if a Person class makes a #has_and_belongs_to_many association to Project,
  #   the association will use "project_id" as the default <tt>:association_foreign_key</tt>.
  # [:validate]
  #   When set to +true+, validates new objects added to association when saving the parent object. +true+ by default.
  #   If you want to ensure associated objects are revalidated on every update, use +validates_associated+.
  # [:autosave]
  #   If true, always save the associated objects or destroy them if marked for destruction, when
  #   saving the parent object.
  #   If false, never save or destroy the associated objects.
  #   By default, only save associated objects that are new records.
  #
  #   Note that NestedAttributes::ClassMethods#accepts_nested_attributes_for sets
  #   <tt>:autosave</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
  #
  # Option examples:
  #   has_and_belongs_to_many :projects
  #   has_and_belongs_to_many :projects, -> { includes(:milestones, :manager) }
  #   has_and_belongs_to_many :nations, class_name: "Country"
  #   has_and_belongs_to_many :categories, join_table: "prods_cats"
  #   has_and_belongs_to_many :categories, -> { readonly }
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/associations.rb:1821
  def has_and_belongs_to_many(name, scope = T.unsafe(nil), **options, &extension); end

  # Specifies a one-to-many association. The following methods for retrieval and query of
  # collections of associated objects will be added:
  #
  # +collection+ is a placeholder for the symbol passed as the +name+ argument, so
  # <tt>has_many :clients</tt> would add among others <tt>clients.empty?</tt>.
  #
  # [collection]
  #   Returns a Relation of all the associated objects.
  #   An empty Relation is returned if none are found.
  # [collection<<(object, ...)]
  #   Adds one or more objects to the collection by setting their foreign keys to the collection's primary key.
  #   Note that this operation instantly fires update SQL without waiting for the save or update call on the
  #   parent object, unless the parent object is a new record.
  #   This will also run validations and callbacks of associated object(s).
  # [collection.delete(object, ...)]
  #   Removes one or more objects from the collection by setting their foreign keys to +NULL+.
  #   Objects will be in addition destroyed if they're associated with <tt>dependent: :destroy</tt>,
  #   and deleted if they're associated with <tt>dependent: :delete_all</tt>.
  #
  #   If the <tt>:through</tt> option is used, then the join records are deleted (rather than
  #   nullified) by default, but you can specify <tt>dependent: :destroy</tt> or
  #   <tt>dependent: :nullify</tt> to override this.
  # [collection.destroy(object, ...)]
  #   Removes one or more objects from the collection by running <tt>destroy</tt> on
  #   each record, regardless of any dependent option, ensuring callbacks are run.
  #
  #   If the <tt>:through</tt> option is used, then the join records are destroyed
  #   instead, not the objects themselves.
  # [collection=objects]
  #   Replaces the collections content by deleting and adding objects as appropriate. If the <tt>:through</tt>
  #   option is true callbacks in the join models are triggered except destroy callbacks, since deletion is
  #   direct by default. You can specify <tt>dependent: :destroy</tt> or
  #   <tt>dependent: :nullify</tt> to override this.
  # [collection_singular_ids]
  #   Returns an array of the associated objects' ids
  # [collection_singular_ids=ids]
  #   Replace the collection with the objects identified by the primary keys in +ids+. This
  #   method loads the models and calls <tt>collection=</tt>. See above.
  # [collection.clear]
  #   Removes every object from the collection. This destroys the associated objects if they
  #   are associated with <tt>dependent: :destroy</tt>, deletes them directly from the
  #   database if <tt>dependent: :delete_all</tt>, otherwise sets their foreign keys to +NULL+.
  #   If the <tt>:through</tt> option is true no destroy callbacks are invoked on the join models.
  #   Join models are directly deleted.
  # [collection.empty?]
  #   Returns +true+ if there are no associated objects.
  # [collection.size]
  #   Returns the number of associated objects.
  # [collection.find(...)]
  #   Finds an associated object according to the same rules as ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#find.
  # [collection.exists?(...)]
  #   Checks whether an associated object with the given conditions exists.
  #   Uses the same rules as ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#exists?.
  # [collection.build(attributes = {}, ...)]
  #   Returns one or more new objects of the collection type that have been instantiated
  #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through a foreign key, but have not yet
  #   been saved.
  # [collection.create(attributes = {})]
  #   Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated
  #   with +attributes+, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that has already
  #   been saved (if it passed the validation). *Note*: This only works if the base model
  #   already exists in the DB, not if it is a new (unsaved) record!
  # [collection.create!(attributes = {})]
  #   Does the same as <tt>collection.create</tt>, but raises ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
  #   if the record is invalid.
  # [collection.reload]
  #   Returns a Relation of all of the associated objects, forcing a database read.
  #   An empty Relation is returned if none are found.
  #
  # === Example
  #
  # A <tt>Firm</tt> class declares <tt>has_many :clients</tt>, which will add:
  # * <tt>Firm#clients</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.where(firm_id: id)</tt>)
  # * <tt>Firm#clients<<</tt>
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.delete</tt>
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.destroy</tt>
  # * <tt>Firm#clients=</tt>
  # * <tt>Firm#client_ids</tt>
  # * <tt>Firm#client_ids=</tt>
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.clear</tt>
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.empty?</tt> (similar to <tt>firm.clients.size == 0</tt>)
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.size</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.count "firm_id = #{id}"</tt>)
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.find</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.where(firm_id: id).find(id)</tt>)
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.exists?(name: 'ACME')</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.exists?(name: 'ACME', firm_id: firm.id)</tt>)
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.build</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.new(firm_id: id)</tt>)
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.create</tt> (similar to <tt>c = Client.new(firm_id: id); c.save; c</tt>)
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.create!</tt> (similar to <tt>c = Client.new(firm_id: id); c.save!</tt>)
  # * <tt>Firm#clients.reload</tt>
  # The declaration can also include an +options+ hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
  #
  # === Scopes
  #
  # You can pass a second argument +scope+ as a callable (i.e. proc or
  # lambda) to retrieve a specific set of records or customize the generated
  # query when you access the associated collection.
  #
  # Scope examples:
  #   has_many :comments, -> { where(author_id: 1) }
  #   has_many :employees, -> { joins(:address) }
  #   has_many :posts, ->(blog) { where("max_post_length > ?", blog.max_post_length) }
  #
  # === Extensions
  #
  # The +extension+ argument allows you to pass a block into a has_many
  # association. This is useful for adding new finders, creators and other
  # factory-type methods to be used as part of the association.
  #
  # Extension examples:
  #   has_many :employees do
  #     def find_or_create_by_name(name)
  #       first_name, last_name = name.split(" ", 2)
  #       find_or_create_by(first_name: first_name, last_name: last_name)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # === Options
  # [:class_name]
  #   Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
  #   from the association name. So <tt>has_many :products</tt> will by default be linked
  #   to the +Product+ class, but if the real class name is +SpecialProduct+, you'll have to
  #   specify it with this option.
  # [:foreign_key]
  #   Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
  #   of this class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So a Person class that makes a #has_many
  #   association will use "person_id" as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>.
  #
  #   If you are going to modify the association (rather than just read from it), then it is
  #   a good idea to set the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option.
  # [:foreign_type]
  #   Specify the column used to store the associated object's type, if this is a polymorphic
  #   association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the polymorphic association
  #   specified on "as" option with a "_type" suffix. So a class that defines a
  #   <tt>has_many :tags, as: :taggable</tt> association will use "taggable_type" as the
  #   default <tt>:foreign_type</tt>.
  # [:primary_key]
  #   Specify the name of the column to use as the primary key for the association. By default this is +id+.
  # [:dependent]
  #   Controls what happens to the associated objects when
  #   their owner is destroyed. Note that these are implemented as
  #   callbacks, and Rails executes callbacks in order. Therefore, other
  #   similar callbacks may affect the <tt>:dependent</tt> behavior, and the
  #   <tt>:dependent</tt> behavior may affect other callbacks.
  #
  #   * <tt>:destroy</tt> causes all the associated objects to also be destroyed.
  #   * <tt>:delete_all</tt> causes all the associated objects to be deleted directly from the database (so callbacks will not be executed).
  #   * <tt>:nullify</tt> causes the foreign keys to be set to +NULL+. Callbacks are not executed.
  #   * <tt>:restrict_with_exception</tt> causes an exception to be raised if there are any associated records.
  #   * <tt>:restrict_with_error</tt> causes an error to be added to the owner if there are any associated objects.
  #
  #   If using with the <tt>:through</tt> option, the association on the join model must be
  #   a #belongs_to, and the records which get deleted are the join records, rather than
  #   the associated records.
  #
  #   If using <tt>dependent: :destroy</tt> on a scoped association, only the scoped objects are destroyed.
  #   For example, if a Post model defines
  #   <tt>has_many :comments, -> { where published: true }, dependent: :destroy</tt> and <tt>destroy</tt> is
  #   called on a post, only published comments are destroyed. This means that any unpublished comments in the
  #   database would still contain a foreign key pointing to the now deleted post.
  # [:counter_cache]
  #   This option can be used to configure a custom named <tt>:counter_cache.</tt> You only need this option,
  #   when you customized the name of your <tt>:counter_cache</tt> on the #belongs_to association.
  # [:as]
  #   Specifies a polymorphic interface (See #belongs_to).
  # [:through]
  #   Specifies an association through which to perform the query. This can be any other type
  #   of association, including other <tt>:through</tt> associations. Options for <tt>:class_name</tt>,
  #   <tt>:primary_key</tt> and <tt>:foreign_key</tt> are ignored, as the association uses the
  #   source reflection.
  #
  #   If the association on the join model is a #belongs_to, the collection can be modified
  #   and the records on the <tt>:through</tt> model will be automatically created and removed
  #   as appropriate. Otherwise, the collection is read-only, so you should manipulate the
  #   <tt>:through</tt> association directly.
  #
  #   If you are going to modify the association (rather than just read from it), then it is
  #   a good idea to set the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option on the source association on the
  #   join model. This allows associated records to be built which will automatically create
  #   the appropriate join model records when they are saved. (See the 'Association Join Models'
  #   section above.)
  # [:source]
  #   Specifies the source association name used by #has_many <tt>:through</tt> queries.
  #   Only use it if the name cannot be inferred from the association.
  #   <tt>has_many :subscribers, through: :subscriptions</tt> will look for either <tt>:subscribers</tt> or
  #   <tt>:subscriber</tt> on Subscription, unless a <tt>:source</tt> is given.
  # [:source_type]
  #   Specifies type of the source association used by #has_many <tt>:through</tt> queries where the source
  #   association is a polymorphic #belongs_to.
  # [:validate]
  #   When set to +true+, validates new objects added to association when saving the parent object. +true+ by default.
  #   If you want to ensure associated objects are revalidated on every update, use +validates_associated+.
  # [:autosave]
  #   If true, always save the associated objects or destroy them if marked for destruction,
  #   when saving the parent object. If false, never save or destroy the associated objects.
  #   By default, only save associated objects that are new records. This option is implemented as a
  #   +before_save+ callback. Because callbacks are run in the order they are defined, associated objects
  #   may need to be explicitly saved in any user-defined +before_save+ callbacks.
  #
  #   Note that NestedAttributes::ClassMethods#accepts_nested_attributes_for sets
  #   <tt>:autosave</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
  # [:inverse_of]
  #   Specifies the name of the #belongs_to association on the associated object
  #   that is the inverse of this #has_many association.
  #   See ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on Bi-directional associations for more detail.
  # [:extend]
  #   Specifies a module or array of modules that will be extended into the association object returned.
  #   Useful for defining methods on associations, especially when they should be shared between multiple
  #   association objects.
  #
  # Option examples:
  #   has_many :comments, -> { order("posted_on") }
  #   has_many :comments, -> { includes(:author) }
  #   has_many :people, -> { where(deleted: false).order("name") }, class_name: "Person"
  #   has_many :tracks, -> { order("position") }, dependent: :destroy
  #   has_many :comments, dependent: :nullify
  #   has_many :tags, as: :taggable
  #   has_many :reports, -> { readonly }
  #   has_many :subscribers, through: :subscriptions, source: :user
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/associations.rb:1368
  def has_many(name, scope = T.unsafe(nil), **options, &extension); end

  # Specifies a one-to-one association with another class. This method should only be used
  # if the other class contains the foreign key. If the current class contains the foreign key,
  # then you should use #belongs_to instead. See also ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview
  # on when to use #has_one and when to use #belongs_to.
  #
  # The following methods for retrieval and query of a single associated object will be added:
  #
  # +association+ is a placeholder for the symbol passed as the +name+ argument, so
  # <tt>has_one :manager</tt> would add among others <tt>manager.nil?</tt>.
  #
  # [association]
  #   Returns the associated object. +nil+ is returned if none is found.
  # [association=(associate)]
  #   Assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, sets it as the foreign key,
  #   and saves the associate object. To avoid database inconsistencies, permanently deletes an existing
  #   associated object when assigning a new one, even if the new one isn't saved to database.
  # [build_association(attributes = {})]
  #   Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated
  #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through a foreign key, but has not
  #   yet been saved.
  # [create_association(attributes = {})]
  #   Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated
  #   with +attributes+, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that
  #   has already been saved (if it passed the validation).
  # [create_association!(attributes = {})]
  #   Does the same as <tt>create_association</tt>, but raises ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
  #   if the record is invalid.
  # [reload_association]
  #   Returns the associated object, forcing a database read.
  #
  # === Example
  #
  # An Account class declares <tt>has_one :beneficiary</tt>, which will add:
  # * <tt>Account#beneficiary</tt> (similar to <tt>Beneficiary.where(account_id: id).first</tt>)
  # * <tt>Account#beneficiary=(beneficiary)</tt> (similar to <tt>beneficiary.account_id = account.id; beneficiary.save</tt>)
  # * <tt>Account#build_beneficiary</tt> (similar to <tt>Beneficiary.new(account_id: id)</tt>)
  # * <tt>Account#create_beneficiary</tt> (similar to <tt>b = Beneficiary.new(account_id: id); b.save; b</tt>)
  # * <tt>Account#create_beneficiary!</tt> (similar to <tt>b = Beneficiary.new(account_id: id); b.save!; b</tt>)
  # * <tt>Account#reload_beneficiary</tt>
  #
  # === Scopes
  #
  # You can pass a second argument +scope+ as a callable (i.e. proc or
  # lambda) to retrieve a specific record or customize the generated query
  # when you access the associated object.
  #
  # Scope examples:
  #   has_one :author, -> { where(comment_id: 1) }
  #   has_one :employer, -> { joins(:company) }
  #   has_one :latest_post, ->(blog) { where("created_at > ?", blog.enabled_at) }
  #
  # === Options
  #
  # The declaration can also include an +options+ hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
  #
  # Options are:
  # [:class_name]
  #   Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
  #   from the association name. So <tt>has_one :manager</tt> will by default be linked to the Manager class, but
  #   if the real class name is Person, you'll have to specify it with this option.
  # [:dependent]
  #   Controls what happens to the associated object when
  #   its owner is destroyed:
  #
  #   * <tt>:destroy</tt> causes the associated object to also be destroyed
  #   * <tt>:delete</tt> causes the associated object to be deleted directly from the database (so callbacks will not execute)
  #   * <tt>:nullify</tt> causes the foreign key to be set to +NULL+. Callbacks are not executed.
  #   * <tt>:restrict_with_exception</tt> causes an exception to be raised if there is an associated record
  #   * <tt>:restrict_with_error</tt> causes an error to be added to the owner if there is an associated object
  #
  #   Note that <tt>:dependent</tt> option is ignored when using <tt>:through</tt> option.
  # [:foreign_key]
  #   Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
  #   of this class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So a Person class that makes a #has_one association
  #   will use "person_id" as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>.
  #
  #   If you are going to modify the association (rather than just read from it), then it is
  #   a good idea to set the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option.
  # [:foreign_type]
  #   Specify the column used to store the associated object's type, if this is a polymorphic
  #   association. By default this is guessed to be the name of the polymorphic association
  #   specified on "as" option with a "_type" suffix. So a class that defines a
  #   <tt>has_one :tag, as: :taggable</tt> association will use "taggable_type" as the
  #   default <tt>:foreign_type</tt>.
  # [:primary_key]
  #   Specify the method that returns the primary key used for the association. By default this is +id+.
  # [:as]
  #   Specifies a polymorphic interface (See #belongs_to).
  # [:through]
  #   Specifies a Join Model through which to perform the query. Options for <tt>:class_name</tt>,
  #   <tt>:primary_key</tt>, and <tt>:foreign_key</tt> are ignored, as the association uses the
  #   source reflection. You can only use a <tt>:through</tt> query through a #has_one
  #   or #belongs_to association on the join model.
  #
  #   If you are going to modify the association (rather than just read from it), then it is
  #   a good idea to set the <tt>:inverse_of</tt> option.
  # [:source]
  #   Specifies the source association name used by #has_one <tt>:through</tt> queries.
  #   Only use it if the name cannot be inferred from the association.
  #   <tt>has_one :favorite, through: :favorites</tt> will look for a
  #   <tt>:favorite</tt> on Favorite, unless a <tt>:source</tt> is given.
  # [:source_type]
  #   Specifies type of the source association used by #has_one <tt>:through</tt> queries where the source
  #   association is a polymorphic #belongs_to.
  # [:validate]
  #   When set to +true+, validates new objects added to association when saving the parent object. +false+ by default.
  #   If you want to ensure associated objects are revalidated on every update, use +validates_associated+.
  # [:autosave]
  #   If true, always save the associated object or destroy it if marked for destruction,
  #   when saving the parent object. If false, never save or destroy the associated object.
  #   By default, only save the associated object if it's a new record.
  #
  #   Note that NestedAttributes::ClassMethods#accepts_nested_attributes_for sets
  #   <tt>:autosave</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
  # [:inverse_of]
  #   Specifies the name of the #belongs_to association on the associated object
  #   that is the inverse of this #has_one association.
  #   See ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's overview on Bi-directional associations for more detail.
  # [:required]
  #   When set to +true+, the association will also have its presence validated.
  #   This will validate the association itself, not the id. You can use
  #   +:inverse_of+ to avoid an extra query during validation.
  #
  # Option examples:
  #   has_one :credit_card, dependent: :destroy  # destroys the associated credit card
  #   has_one :credit_card, dependent: :nullify  # updates the associated records foreign
  #                                                 # key value to NULL rather than destroying it

# = Active Record Association Collection
#
# CollectionAssociation is an abstract class that provides common stuff to
# ease the implementation of association proxies that represent
# collections. See the class hierarchy in Association.
#
#   CollectionAssociation:
#     HasManyAssociation => has_many
#       HasManyThroughAssociation + ThroughAssociation => has_many :through
#
# The CollectionAssociation class provides common methods to the collections
# defined by +has_and_belongs_to_many+, +has_many+ or +has_many+ with
# the +:through association+ option.
#
# You need to be careful with assumptions regarding the target: The proxy
# does not fetch records from the database until it needs them, but new
# ones created with +build+ are added to the target. So, the target may be
# non-empty and still lack children waiting to be read from the database.
# If you look directly to the database you cannot assume that's the entire
# collection because new records may have been added to the target, etc.
#
# If you need to work on all current children, new and existing records,
# +load_target+ and the +loaded+ flag are your friends.

  #
  # This method is abstract in the sense that +delete_records+ has to be

# Association proxies in Active Record are middlemen between the object that

# object, known as the <tt>@target</tt>. The kind of association any proxy is
# about is available in <tt>@reflection</tt>. That's an instance of the class
# ActiveRecord::Reflection::AssociationReflection.
#
# For example, given
#
#   class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts
#   end
#
#   blog = Blog.first
#
# the association proxy in <tt>blog.posts</tt> has the object in +blog+ as
# <tt>@owner</tt>, the collection of its posts as <tt>@target</tt>, and
# the <tt>@reflection</tt> object represents a <tt>:has_many</tt> macro.
#
# This class delegates unknown methods to <tt>@target</tt> via
# <tt>method_missing</tt>.
#
# The <tt>@target</tt> object is not \loaded until needed. For example,
#
#   blog.posts.count
#
# is computed directly through SQL and does not trigger by itself the
# instantiation of the actual post records.

# Implements the details of eager loading of Active Record associations.
#
# Suppose that you have the following two Active Record models:
#
#   class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # columns: name, age
#     has_many :books
#   end
#
#   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # columns: title, sales, author_id
#   end
#
# When you load an author with all associated books Active Record will make
# multiple queries like this:
#
#   Author.includes(:books).where(name: ['bell hooks', 'Homer']).to_a
#
#   => SELECT `authors`.* FROM `authors` WHERE `name` IN ('bell hooks', 'Homer')
#   => SELECT `books`.* FROM `books` WHERE `author_id` IN (2, 5)
#
# Active Record saves the ids of the records from the first query to use in
# the second. Depending on the number of associations involved there can be
# arbitrarily many SQL queries made.
#
# However, if there is a WHERE clause that spans across tables Active
# Record will fall back to a slightly more resource-intensive single query:
#
#   Author.includes(:books).where(books: {title: 'Illiad'}).to_a
#   => SELECT `authors`.`id` AS t0_r0, `authors`.`name` AS t0_r1, `authors`.`age` AS t0_r2,
#             `books`.`id`   AS t1_r0, `books`.`title`  AS t1_r1, `books`.`sales` AS t1_r2
#      FROM `authors`
#      LEFT OUTER JOIN `books` ON `authors`.`id` =  `books`.`author_id`
#      WHERE `books`.`title` = 'Illiad'
#
# This could result in many rows that contain redundant data and it performs poorly at scale
# and is therefore only used when necessary.
#

class ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader
  extend ::ActiveSupport::Autoload

  # Eager loads the named associations for the given Active Record record(s).
  #
  # In this description, 'association name' shall refer to the name passed
  # to an association creation method. For example, a model that specifies
  # <tt>belongs_to :author</tt>, <tt>has_many :buyers</tt> has association
  # names +:author+ and +:buyers+.
  #
  # == Parameters
  # +records+ is an array of ActiveRecord::Base. This array needs not be flat,
  # i.e. +records+ itself may also contain arrays of records. In any case,
  # +preload_associations+ will preload the all associations records by
  # flattening +records+.
  #
  # +associations+ specifies one or more associations that you want to
  # preload. It may be:
  # - a Symbol or a String which specifies a single association name. For
  #   example, specifying +:books+ allows this method to preload all books
  #   for an Author.
  # - an Array which specifies multiple association names. This array
  #   is processed recursively. For example, specifying <tt>[:avatar, :books]</tt>
  #   allows this method to preload an author's avatar as well as all of his
  #   books.
  # - a Hash which specifies multiple association names, as well as
  #   association names for the to-be-preloaded association objects. For
  #   example, specifying <tt>{ author: :avatar }</tt> will preload a
  #   book's author, as well as that author's avatar.
  #
  # +:associations+ has the same format as the +:include+ option for
  # <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.find</tt>. So +associations+ could look like this:
  #
  #   :books
  #   [ :books, :author ]
  #   { author: :avatar }
  #   [ :books, { author: :avatar } ]

  # If you have an attribute that needs to be saved to the database as an
  # object, and retrieved as the same object, then specify the name of that
  # attribute using this method and it will be handled automatically. The
  # serialization is done through YAML. If +class_name+ is specified, the
  # serialized object must be of that class on assignment and retrieval.
  # Otherwise SerializationTypeMismatch will be raised.
  #
  # Empty objects as <tt>{}</tt>, in the case of +Hash+, or <tt>[]</tt>, in the case of
  # +Array+, will always be persisted as null.
  #
  # Keep in mind that database adapters handle certain serialization tasks
  # for you. For instance: +json+ and +jsonb+ types in PostgreSQL will be
  # converted between JSON object/array syntax and Ruby +Hash+ or +Array+
  # objects transparently. There is no need to use #serialize in this
  # case.
  #
  # For more complex cases, such as conversion to or from your application
  # domain objects, consider using the ActiveRecord::Attributes API.

  # ==== Parameters
  #
  # * +attr_name+ - The field name that should be serialized.
  # * +class_name_or_coder+ - Optional, a coder object, which responds to +.load+ and +.dump+
  #   or a class name that the object type should be equal to.
  #
  # ==== Example
  #
  #   # Serialize a preferences attribute.
  #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base

module ActiveRecord::Attributes::ClassMethods
  # Defines an attribute with a type on this model. It will override the
  # type of existing attributes if needed. This allows control over how
  # values are converted to and from SQL when assigned to a model. It also
  # changes the behavior of values passed to
  # {ActiveRecord::Base.where}[rdoc-ref:QueryMethods#where]. This will let you use
  # your domain objects across much of Active Record, without having to
  # rely on implementation details or monkey patching.
  #
  # +name+ The name of the methods to define attribute methods for, and the
  # column which this will persist to.
  #
  # +cast_type+ A symbol such as +:string+ or +:integer+, or a type object
  # to be used for this attribute. See the examples below for more
  # information about providing custom type objects.
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # The following options are accepted:
  #
  # +default+ The default value to use when no value is provided. If this option
  # is not passed, the previous default value (if any) will be used.
  # Otherwise, the default will be +nil+.
  #
  # +array+ (PostgreSQL only) specifies that the type should be an array (see the
  # examples below).
  #
  # +range+ (PostgreSQL only) specifies that the type should be a range (see the
  # examples below).
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  # The type detected by Active Record can be overridden.
  #
  #   # db/schema.rb
  #   create_table :store_listings, force: true do |t|
  #     t.decimal :price_in_cents
  #   end
  #
  #   # app/models/store_listing.rb
  #   class StoreListing < ActiveRecord::Base
  #   end
  #
  #   store_listing = StoreListing.new(price_in_cents: '10.1')
  #
  #   # before
  #   store_listing.price_in_cents # => BigDecimal(10.1)
  #
  #   class StoreListing < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     attribute :price_in_cents, :integer
  #   end
  #
  #   # after
  #   store_listing.price_in_cents # => 10
  #
  # A default can also be provided.
  #
  #   # db/schema.rb
  #   create_table :store_listings, force: true do |t|
  #     t.string :my_string, default: "original default"
  #   end
  #
  #   StoreListing.new.my_string # => "original default"
  #
  #   # app/models/store_listing.rb
  #   class StoreListing < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     attribute :my_string, :string, default: "new default"
  #   end
  #
  #   StoreListing.new.my_string # => "new default"
  #
  #   class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     attribute :my_default_proc, :datetime, default: -> { Time.now }
  #   end
  #
  #   Product.new.my_default_proc # => 2015-05-30 11:04:48 -0600
  #   sleep 1
  #   Product.new.my_default_proc # => 2015-05-30 11:04:49 -0600
  #
  # \Attributes do not need to be backed by a database column.
  #
  #   # app/models/my_model.rb
  #   class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     attribute :my_string, :string
  #     attribute :my_int_array, :integer, array: true
  #     attribute :my_float_range, :float, range: true
  #   end
  #
  #   model = MyModel.new(
  #     my_string: "string",
  #     my_int_array: ["1", "2", "3"],
  #     my_float_range: "[1,3.5]",
  #   )
  #   model.attributes
  #   # =>
  #     {
  #       my_string: "string",
  #       my_int_array: [1, 2, 3],
  #       my_float_range: 1.0..3.5
  #     }
  #
  # ==== Creating Custom Types
  #
  # Users may also define their own custom types, as long as they respond
  # to the methods defined on the value type. The method +deserialize+ or
  # +cast+ will be called on your type object, with raw input from the
  # database or from your controllers. See ActiveModel::Type::Value for the
  # expected API. It is recommended that your type objects inherit from an
  # existing type, or from ActiveRecord::Type::Value
  #
  #   class MoneyType < ActiveRecord::Type::Integer
  #     def cast(value)
  #       if !value.kind_of?(Numeric) && value.include?('$')
  #         price_in_dollars = value.gsub(/\$/, '').to_f
  #         super(price_in_dollars * 100)
  #       else
  #         super
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   # config/initializers/types.rb
  #   ActiveRecord::Type.register(:money, MoneyType)
  #
  #   # app/models/store_listing.rb
  #   class StoreListing < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     attribute :price_in_cents, :money
  #   end
  #
  #   store_listing = StoreListing.new(price_in_cents: '$10.00')
  #   store_listing.price_in_cents # => 1000
  #
  # For more details on creating custom types, see the documentation for
  # ActiveModel::Type::Value. For more details on registering your types
  # to be referenced by a symbol, see ActiveRecord::Type.register. You can
  # also pass a type object directly, in place of a symbol.
  #
  # ==== \Querying
  #
  # When {ActiveRecord::Base.where}[rdoc-ref:QueryMethods#where] is called, it will
  # use the type defined by the model class to convert the value to SQL,
  # calling +serialize+ on your type object. For example:
  #
  #   class Money < Struct.new(:amount, :currency)
  #   end
  #
  #   class MoneyType < Type::Value
  #     def initialize(currency_converter:)
  #       @currency_converter = currency_converter
  #     end
  #
  #     # value will be the result of +deserialize+ or
  #     # +cast+. Assumed to be an instance of +Money+ in
  #     # this case.
  #     def serialize(value)
  #       value_in_bitcoins = @currency_converter.convert_to_bitcoins(value)
  #       value_in_bitcoins.amount
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   # config/initializers/types.rb
  #   ActiveRecord::Type.register(:money, MoneyType)
  #
  #   # app/models/product.rb
  #   class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     currency_converter = ConversionRatesFromTheInternet.new
  #     attribute :price_in_bitcoins, :money, currency_converter: currency_converter
  #   end
  #
  #   Product.where(price_in_bitcoins: Money.new(5, "USD"))
  #   # => SELECT * FROM products WHERE price_in_bitcoins = 0.02230
  #
  #   Product.where(price_in_bitcoins: Money.new(5, "GBP"))
  #   # => SELECT * FROM products WHERE price_in_bitcoins = 0.03412
  #
  # ==== Dirty Tracking
  #
  # The type of an attribute is given the opportunity to change how dirty
  # tracking is performed. The methods +changed?+ and +changed_in_place?+
  # will be called from ActiveModel::Dirty. See the documentation for those
  # methods in ActiveModel::Type::Value for more details.
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/attributes.rb:195
  def attribute(name, cast_type = T.unsafe(nil), **options); end

  # This is the low level API which sits beneath +attribute+. It only
  # accepts type objects, and will do its work immediately instead of
  # waiting for the schema to load. Automatic schema detection and
  # ClassMethods#attribute both call this under the hood. While this method
  # is provided so it can be used by plugin authors, application code
  # should probably use ClassMethods#attribute.
  #
  # +name+ The name of the attribute being defined. Expected to be a +String+.
  #
  # +cast_type+ The type object to use for this attribute.
  #
  # +default+ The default value to use when no value is provided. If this option
  # is not passed, the previous default value (if any) will be used.
  # Otherwise, the default will be +nil+. A proc can also be passed, and
  # will be called once each time a new value is needed.
  #
  # +user_provided_default+ Whether the default value should be cast using
  # +cast+ or +deserialize+.
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/attributes.rb:223
  def define_attribute(name, cast_type, default: T.unsafe(nil), user_provided_default: T.unsafe(nil)); end

# = Active Record Autosave Association
#
# AutosaveAssociation is a module that takes care of automatically saving
# associated records when their parent is saved. In addition to saving, it
# also destroys any associated records that were marked for destruction.
# (See #mark_for_destruction and #marked_for_destruction?).
#
# Saving of the parent, its associations, and the destruction of marked
# associations, all happen inside a transaction. This should never leave the
# database in an inconsistent state.
#
# If validations for any of the associations fail, their error messages will
# be applied to the parent.
#
# Note that it also means that associations marked for destruction won't
# be destroyed directly. They will however still be marked for destruction.
#
# Note that <tt>autosave: false</tt> is not same as not declaring <tt>:autosave</tt>.
# When the <tt>:autosave</tt> option is not present then new association records are
# saved but the updated association records are not saved.
#
# == Validation
#
# Child records are validated unless <tt>:validate</tt> is +false+.
#
# == Callbacks
#
# Association with autosave option defines several callbacks on your
# model (before_save, after_create, after_update). Please note that
# callbacks are executed in the order they were defined in
# model. You should avoid modifying the association content, before
# autosave callbacks are executed. Placing your callbacks after
# associations is usually a good practice.
#
# === One-to-one Example
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_one :author, autosave: true
#   end
#
# Saving changes to the parent and its associated model can now be performed
# automatically _and_ atomically:
#
#   post = Post.find(1)
#   post.title       # => "The current global position of migrating ducks"
#   post.author.name # => "alloy"
#
#   post.title = "On the migration of ducks"
#   post.author.name = "Eloy Duran"
#
#   post.save
#   post.reload
#   post.title       # => "On the migration of ducks"
#   post.author.name # => "Eloy Duran"
#
# Destroying an associated model, as part of the parent's save action, is as
# simple as marking it for destruction:
#
#   post.author.mark_for_destruction
#   post.author.marked_for_destruction? # => true
#
# Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:
#
#   id = post.author.id
#   Author.find_by(id: id).nil? # => false
#
#   post.save
#   post.reload.author # => nil
#
# Now it _is_ removed from the database:
#
#   Author.find_by(id: id).nil? # => true
#
# === One-to-many Example
#
# When <tt>:autosave</tt> is not declared new children are saved when their parent is saved:
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :comments # :autosave option is not declared
#   end
#
#   post = Post.new(title: 'ruby rocks')
#   post.comments.build(body: 'hello world')
#   post.save # => saves both post and comment
#
#   post = Post.create(title: 'ruby rocks')
#   post.comments.build(body: 'hello world')
#   post.save # => saves both post and comment
#
#   post = Post.create(title: 'ruby rocks')
#   post.comments.create(body: 'hello world')
#   post.save # => saves both post and comment
#
# When <tt>:autosave</tt> is true all children are saved, no matter whether they
# are new records or not:
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :comments, autosave: true
#   end
#
#   post = Post.create(title: 'ruby rocks')
#   post.comments.create(body: 'hello world')
#   post.comments[0].body = 'hi everyone'
#   post.comments.build(body: "good morning.")
#   post.title += "!"
#   post.save # => saves both post and comments.
#
# Destroying one of the associated models as part of the parent's save action
# is as simple as marking it for destruction:
#
#   post.comments # => [#<Comment id: 1, ...>, #<Comment id: 2, ...]>
#   post.comments[1].mark_for_destruction
#   post.comments[1].marked_for_destruction? # => true
#   post.comments.length # => 2
#
# Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:
#
#   id = post.comments.last.id
#   Comment.find_by(id: id).nil? # => false
#
#   post.save
#   post.reload.comments.length # => 1
#
# Now it _is_ removed from the database:
#
#   Comment.find_by(id: id).nil? # => true

  # Adds validation and save callbacks for the association as specified by

  #
  # For performance reasons, we don't check whether to validate at runtime.
  # However the validation and callback methods are lazy and those methods
  # get created when they are invoked for the very first time. However,
  # this can change, for instance, when using nested attributes, which is
  # called _after_ the association has been defined. Since we don't want
  # the callbacks to get defined multiple times, there are guards that
  # check if the save or validation methods have already been defined
  # before actually defining them.

# = Active Record
#
# Active Record objects don't specify their attributes directly, but rather infer them from
# the table definition with which they're linked. Adding, removing, and changing attributes
# and their type is done directly in the database. Any change is instantly reflected in the
# Active Record objects. The mapping that binds a given Active Record class to a certain
# database table will happen automatically in most common cases, but can be overwritten for the uncommon ones.
#
# See the mapping rules in table_name and the full example in link:files/activerecord/README_rdoc.html for more insight.
#
# == Creation
#
# Active Records accept constructor parameters either in a hash or as a block. The hash
# method is especially useful when you're receiving the data from somewhere else, like an
# HTTP request. It works like this:
#
#   user = User.new(name: "David", occupation: "Code Artist")
#   user.name # => "David"
#
# You can also use block initialization:
#
#   user = User.new do |u|
#     u.name = "David"
#     u.occupation = "Code Artist"
#   end
#
# And of course you can just create a bare object and specify the attributes after the fact:
#
#   user = User.new
#   user.name = "David"
#   user.occupation = "Code Artist"
#
# == Conditions
#
# Conditions can either be specified as a string, array, or hash representing the WHERE-part of an SQL statement.
# The array form is to be used when the condition input is tainted and requires sanitization. The string form can
# be used for statements that don't involve tainted data. The hash form works much like the array form, except
# only equality and range is possible. Examples:
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     def self.authenticate_unsafely(user_name, password)
#       where("user_name = '#{user_name}' AND password = '#{password}'").first
#     end
#
#     def self.authenticate_safely(user_name, password)
#       where("user_name = ? AND password = ?", user_name, password).first
#     end
#
#     def self.authenticate_safely_simply(user_name, password)
#       where(user_name: user_name, password: password).first
#     end
#   end
#
# The <tt>authenticate_unsafely</tt> method inserts the parameters directly into the query
# and is thus susceptible to SQL-injection attacks if the <tt>user_name</tt> and +password+
# parameters come directly from an HTTP request. The <tt>authenticate_safely</tt> and
# <tt>authenticate_safely_simply</tt> both will sanitize the <tt>user_name</tt> and +password+
# before inserting them in the query, which will ensure that an attacker can't escape the
# query and fake the login (or worse).
#
# When using multiple parameters in the conditions, it can easily become hard to read exactly
# what the fourth or fifth question mark is supposed to represent. In those cases, you can
# resort to named bind variables instead. That's done by replacing the question marks with
# symbols and supplying a hash with values for the matching symbol keys:
#
#   Company.where(
#     "id = :id AND name = :name AND division = :division AND created_at > :accounting_date",
#     { id: 3, name: "37signals", division: "First", accounting_date: '2005-01-01' }
#   ).first
#
# Similarly, a simple hash without a statement will generate conditions based on equality with the SQL AND
# operator. For instance:
#
#   Student.where(first_name: "Harvey", status: 1)
#   Student.where(params[:student])
#
# A range may be used in the hash to use the SQL BETWEEN operator:
#
#   Student.where(grade: 9..12)
#
# An array may be used in the hash to use the SQL IN operator:
#
#   Student.where(grade: [9,11,12])
#
# When joining tables, nested hashes or keys written in the form 'table_name.column_name'
# can be used to qualify the table name of a particular condition. For instance:
#
#   Student.joins(:schools).where(schools: { category: 'public' })
#   Student.joins(:schools).where('schools.category' => 'public' )
#
# == Overwriting default accessors
#
# All column values are automatically available through basic accessors on the Active Record
# object, but sometimes you want to specialize this behavior. This can be done by overwriting
# the default accessors (using the same name as the attribute) and calling
# +super+ to actually change things.
#
#   class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # Uses an integer of seconds to hold the length of the song
#
#     def length=(minutes)
#       super(minutes.to_i * 60)
#     end
#
#     def length
#       super / 60
#     end
#   end
#
# == Attribute query methods
#
# In addition to the basic accessors, query methods are also automatically available on the Active Record object.
# Query methods allow you to test whether an attribute value is present.
# Additionally, when dealing with numeric values, a query method will return false if the value is zero.
#
# For example, an Active Record User with the <tt>name</tt> attribute has a <tt>name?</tt> method that you can call
# to determine whether the user has a name:
#
#   user = User.new(name: "David")
#   user.name? # => true
#
#   anonymous = User.new(name: "")
#   anonymous.name? # => false
#
# == Accessing attributes before they have been typecasted
#
# Sometimes you want to be able to read the raw attribute data without having the column-determined
# typecast run its course first. That can be done by using the <tt><attribute>_before_type_cast</tt>
# accessors that all attributes have. For example, if your Account model has a <tt>balance</tt> attribute,
# you can call <tt>account.balance_before_type_cast</tt> or <tt>account.id_before_type_cast</tt>.
#
# This is especially useful in validation situations where the user might supply a string for an
# integer field and you want to display the original string back in an error message. Accessing the
# attribute normally would typecast the string to 0, which isn't what you want.
#
# == Dynamic attribute-based finders
#
# Dynamic attribute-based finders are a mildly deprecated way of getting (and/or creating) objects
# by simple queries without turning to SQL. They work by appending the name of an attribute
# to <tt>find_by_</tt> like <tt>Person.find_by_user_name</tt>.
# Instead of writing <tt>Person.find_by(user_name: user_name)</tt>, you can use
# <tt>Person.find_by_user_name(user_name)</tt>.
#
# It's possible to add an exclamation point (!) on the end of the dynamic finders to get them to raise an
# ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error if they do not return any records,
# like <tt>Person.find_by_last_name!</tt>.
#
# It's also possible to use multiple attributes in the same <tt>find_by_</tt> by separating them with
# "_and_".
#
#  Person.find_by(user_name: user_name, password: password)
#  Person.find_by_user_name_and_password(user_name, password) # with dynamic finder
#
# It's even possible to call these dynamic finder methods on relations and named scopes.
#
#   Payment.order("created_on").find_by_amount(50)
#
# == Saving arrays, hashes, and other non-mappable objects in text columns
#
# Active Record can serialize any object in text columns using YAML. To do so, you must
# specify this with a call to the class method
# {serialize}[rdoc-ref:AttributeMethods::Serialization::ClassMethods#serialize].
# This makes it possible to store arrays, hashes, and other non-mappable objects without doing
# any additional work.
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     serialize :preferences
#   end
#
#   user = User.create(preferences: { "background" => "black", "display" => large })
#   User.find(user.id).preferences # => { "background" => "black", "display" => large }
#
# You can also specify a class option as the second parameter that'll raise an exception
# if a serialized object is retrieved as a descendant of a class not in the hierarchy.
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     serialize :preferences, Hash
#   end
#
#   user = User.create(preferences: %w( one two three ))
#   User.find(user.id).preferences    # raises SerializationTypeMismatch
#
# When you specify a class option, the default value for that attribute will be a new
# instance of that class.
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     serialize :preferences, OpenStruct
#   end
#
#   user = User.new
#   user.preferences.theme_color = "red"
#
#
# == Single table inheritance
#
# Active Record allows inheritance by storing the name of the class in a
# column that is named "type" by default. See ActiveRecord::Inheritance for
# more details.
#
# == Connection to multiple databases in different models
#
# Connections are usually created through
# {ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#establish_connection] and retrieved
# by ActiveRecord::Base.connection. All classes inheriting from ActiveRecord::Base will use this
# connection. But you can also set a class-specific connection. For example, if Course is an
# ActiveRecord::Base, but resides in a different database, you can just say <tt>Course.establish_connection</tt>
# and Course and all of its subclasses will use this connection instead.
#
# This feature is implemented by keeping a connection pool in ActiveRecord::Base that is
# a hash indexed by the class. If a connection is requested, the
# {ActiveRecord::Base.retrieve_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#retrieve_connection] method
# will go up the class-hierarchy until a connection is found in the connection pool.
#
# == Exceptions
#
# * ActiveRecordError - Generic error class and superclass of all other errors raised by Active Record.
# * AdapterNotSpecified - The configuration hash used in
#   {ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#establish_connection]
#   didn't include an <tt>:adapter</tt> key.
# * AdapterNotFound - The <tt>:adapter</tt> key used in
#   {ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#establish_connection]
#   specified a non-existent adapter
#   (or a bad spelling of an existing one).
# * AssociationTypeMismatch - The object assigned to the association wasn't of the type
#   specified in the association definition.
# * AttributeAssignmentError - An error occurred while doing a mass assignment through the
#   {ActiveRecord::Base#attributes=}[rdoc-ref:AttributeAssignment#attributes=] method.
#   You can inspect the +attribute+ property of the exception object to determine which attribute
#   triggered the error.
# * ConnectionNotEstablished - No connection has been established.
#   Use {ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling#establish_connection] before querying.
# * MultiparameterAssignmentErrors - Collection of errors that occurred during a mass assignment using the
#   {ActiveRecord::Base#attributes=}[rdoc-ref:AttributeAssignment#attributes=] method.
#   The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of
#   AttributeAssignmentError
#   objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.
# * RecordInvalid - raised by {ActiveRecord::Base#save!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save!] and
#   {ActiveRecord::Base.create!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence::ClassMethods#create!]
#   when the record is invalid.
# * RecordNotFound - No record responded to the {ActiveRecord::Base.find}[rdoc-ref:FinderMethods#find] method.
#   Either the row with the given ID doesn't exist or the row didn't meet the additional restrictions.
#   Some {ActiveRecord::Base.find}[rdoc-ref:FinderMethods#find] calls do not raise this exception to signal
#   nothing was found, please check its documentation for further details.
# * SerializationTypeMismatch - The serialized object wasn't of the class specified as the second parameter.
# * StatementInvalid - The database server rejected the SQL statement. The precise error is added in the message.
#
# *Note*: The attributes listed are class-level attributes (accessible from both the class and instance level).
# So it's possible to assign a logger to the class through <tt>Base.logger=</tt> which will then be used by all
# instances in the current object space.

  # In that case, batch processing methods allow you to work

  # ==== Options
  # * <tt>:batch_size</tt> - Specifies the size of the batch. Defaults to 1000.

# = Active Record \Callbacks
#
# \Callbacks are hooks into the life cycle of an Active Record object that allow you to trigger logic
# before or after an alteration of the object state. This can be used to make sure that associated and
# dependent objects are deleted when {ActiveRecord::Base#destroy}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy] is called (by overwriting +before_destroy+) or
# to massage attributes before they're validated (by overwriting +before_validation+).
# As an example of the callbacks initiated, consider the {ActiveRecord::Base#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save] call for a new record:
#
# * (-) <tt>save</tt>
# * (-) <tt>valid</tt>
# * (1) <tt>before_validation</tt>
# * (-) <tt>validate</tt>
# * (2) <tt>after_validation</tt>
# * (3) <tt>before_save</tt>
# * (4) <tt>before_create</tt>
# * (-) <tt>create</tt>
# * (5) <tt>after_create</tt>
# * (6) <tt>after_save</tt>
# * (7) <tt>after_commit</tt>
#
# Also, an <tt>after_rollback</tt> callback can be configured to be triggered whenever a rollback is issued.
# Check out ActiveRecord::Transactions for more details about <tt>after_commit</tt> and
# <tt>after_rollback</tt>.
#
# Additionally, an <tt>after_touch</tt> callback is triggered whenever an
# object is touched.
#
# Lastly an <tt>after_find</tt> and <tt>after_initialize</tt> callback is triggered for each object that
# is found and instantiated by a finder, with <tt>after_initialize</tt> being triggered after new objects
# are instantiated as well.
#
# There are nineteen callbacks in total, which give you immense power to react and prepare for each state in the
# Active Record life cycle. The sequence for calling {ActiveRecord::Base#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save] for an existing record is similar,
# except that each <tt>_create</tt> callback is replaced by the corresponding <tt>_update</tt> callback.
#
# Examples:
#   class CreditCard < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # Strip everything but digits, so the user can specify "555 234 34" or
#     # "5552-3434" and both will mean "55523434"
#     before_validation(on: :create) do
#       self.number = number.gsub(/[^0-9]/, "") if attribute_present?("number")
#     end
#   end
#
#   class Subscription < ActiveRecord::Base
#     before_create :record_signup
#
#     private
#       def record_signup
#         self.signed_up_on = Date.today
#       end
#   end
#
#   class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # Disables access to the system, for associated clients and people when the firm is destroyed
#     before_destroy { |record| Person.where(firm_id: record.id).update_all(access: 'disabled')   }
#     before_destroy { |record| Client.where(client_of: record.id).update_all(access: 'disabled') }
#   end
#
# == Inheritable callback queues
#
# Besides the overwritable callback methods, it's also possible to register callbacks through the
# use of the callback macros. Their main advantage is that the macros add behavior into a callback
# queue that is kept intact down through an inheritance hierarchy.
#
#   class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
#     before_destroy :destroy_author
#   end
#
#   class Reply < Topic
#     before_destroy :destroy_readers
#   end
#
# Now, when <tt>Topic#destroy</tt> is run only +destroy_author+ is called. When <tt>Reply#destroy</tt> is
# run, both +destroy_author+ and +destroy_readers+ are called. Contrast this to the following situation
# where the +before_destroy+ method is overridden:
#
#   class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
#     def before_destroy() destroy_author end
#   end
#
#   class Reply < Topic
#     def before_destroy() destroy_readers end
#   end
#
# In that case, <tt>Reply#destroy</tt> would only run +destroy_readers+ and _not_ +destroy_author+.
# So, use the callback macros when you want to ensure that a certain callback is called for the entire
# hierarchy, and use the regular overwritable methods when you want to leave it up to each descendant
# to decide whether they want to call +super+ and trigger the inherited callbacks.
#
# *IMPORTANT:* In order for inheritance to work for the callback queues, you must specify the
# callbacks before specifying the associations. Otherwise, you might trigger the loading of a
# child before the parent has registered the callbacks and they won't be inherited.
#
# == Types of callbacks
#
# There are four types of callbacks accepted by the callback macros: Method references (symbol), callback objects,
# inline methods (using a proc). Method references and callback objects
# are the recommended approaches, inline methods using a proc are sometimes appropriate (such as for
# creating mix-ins).
#
# The method reference callbacks work by specifying a protected or private method available in the object, like this:
#
#   class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
#     before_destroy :delete_parents
#
#     private
#       def delete_parents
#         self.class.delete_all "parent_id = #{id}"
#       end
#   end
#
# The callback objects have methods named after the callback called with the record as the only parameter, such as:
#
#   class BankAccount < ActiveRecord::Base
#     before_save      EncryptionWrapper.new
#     after_save       EncryptionWrapper.new
#     after_initialize EncryptionWrapper.new
#   end
#
#   class EncryptionWrapper
#     def before_save(record)
#       record.credit_card_number = encrypt(record.credit_card_number)
#     end
#
#     def after_save(record)
#       record.credit_card_number = decrypt(record.credit_card_number)
#     end
#
#     alias_method :after_initialize, :after_save
#
#     private
#       def encrypt(value)
#         # Secrecy is committed
#       end
#
#       def decrypt(value)
#         # Secrecy is unveiled
#       end
#   end
#
# So you specify the object you want messaged on a given callback. When that callback is triggered, the object has
# a method by the name of the callback messaged. You can make these callbacks more flexible by passing in other
# initialization data such as the name of the attribute to work with:
#
#   class BankAccount < ActiveRecord::Base
#     before_save      EncryptionWrapper.new("credit_card_number")
#     after_save       EncryptionWrapper.new("credit_card_number")
#     after_initialize EncryptionWrapper.new("credit_card_number")
#   end
#
#   class EncryptionWrapper
#     def initialize(attribute)
#       @attribute = attribute
#     end
#
#     def before_save(record)
#       record.send("#{@attribute}=", encrypt(record.send("#{@attribute}")))
#     end
#
#     def after_save(record)
#       record.send("#{@attribute}=", decrypt(record.send("#{@attribute}")))
#     end
#
#     alias_method :after_initialize, :after_save
#
#     private
#       def encrypt(value)
#         # Secrecy is committed
#       end
#
#       def decrypt(value)
#         # Secrecy is unveiled
#       end
#   end
#
# == <tt>before_validation*</tt> returning statements
#
# If the +before_validation+ callback throws +:abort+, the process will be
# aborted and {ActiveRecord::Base#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save] will return +false+.
# If {ActiveRecord::Base#save!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save!] is called it will raise an ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid exception.
# Nothing will be appended to the errors object.
#
# == Canceling callbacks
#
# If a <tt>before_*</tt> callback throws +:abort+, all the later callbacks and
# the associated action are cancelled.
# Callbacks are generally run in the order they are defined, with the exception of callbacks defined as
# methods on the model, which are called last.
#
# == Ordering callbacks
#
# Sometimes the code needs that the callbacks execute in a specific order. For example, a +before_destroy+
# callback (+log_children+ in this case) should be executed before the children get destroyed by the
# <tt>dependent: :destroy</tt> option.
#
# Let's look at the code below:
#
#   class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :children, dependent: :destroy
#
#     before_destroy :log_children
#
#     private
#       def log_children
#         # Child processing
#       end
#   end
#
# In this case, the problem is that when the +before_destroy+ callback is executed, the children are not available
# because the {ActiveRecord::Base#destroy}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy] callback gets executed first.
# You can use the +prepend+ option on the +before_destroy+ callback to avoid this.
#
#   class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :children, dependent: :destroy
#
#     before_destroy :log_children, prepend: true
#
#     private
#       def log_children
#         # Child processing
#       end
#   end
#
# This way, the +before_destroy+ gets executed before the <tt>dependent: :destroy</tt> is called, and the data is still available.
#
# Also, there are cases when you want several callbacks of the same type to
# be executed in order.
#
# For example:
#
#   class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :children
#
#     after_save :log_children
#     after_save :do_something_else
#
#     private
#
#     def log_children
#       # Child processing
#     end
#
#     def do_something_else
#       # Something else
#     end
#   end
#
# In this case the +log_children+ gets executed before +do_something_else+.
# The same applies to all non-transactional callbacks.
#
# In case there are multiple transactional callbacks as seen below, the order
# is reversed.
#
# For example:
#
#   class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :children
#
#     after_commit :log_children
#     after_commit :do_something_else
#
#     private
#
#     def log_children
#       # Child processing
#     end
#
#     def do_something_else
#       # Something else
#     end
#   end
#
# In this case the +do_something_else+ gets executed before +log_children+.
#
# == \Transactions
#
# The entire callback chain of a {#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save], {#save!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save!],
# or {#destroy}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy] call runs within a transaction. That includes <tt>after_*</tt> hooks.
# If everything goes fine a COMMIT is executed once the chain has been completed.
#
# If a <tt>before_*</tt> callback cancels the action a ROLLBACK is issued. You
# can also trigger a ROLLBACK raising an exception in any of the callbacks,
# including <tt>after_*</tt> hooks. Note, however, that in that case the client
# needs to be aware of it because an ordinary {#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save] will raise such exception
# instead of quietly returning +false+.
#
# == Debugging callbacks
#
# The callback chain is accessible via the <tt>_*_callbacks</tt> method on an object. Active Model \Callbacks support
# <tt>:before</tt>, <tt>:after</tt> and <tt>:around</tt> as values for the <tt>kind</tt> property. The <tt>kind</tt> property
# defines what part of the chain the callback runs in.
#
# To find all callbacks in the before_save callback chain:
#
#   Topic._save_callbacks.select { |cb| cb.kind.eql?(:before) }
#
# Returns an array of callback objects that form the before_save chain.
#
# To further check if the before_save chain contains a proc defined as <tt>rest_when_dead</tt> use the <tt>filter</tt> property of the callback object:
#
#   Topic._save_callbacks.select { |cb| cb.kind.eql?(:before) }.collect(&:filter).include?(:rest_when_dead)
#
# Returns true or false depending on whether the proc is contained in the before_save callback chain on a Topic model.

# ConnectionHandler is a collection of ConnectionPool objects. It is used
# for keeping separate connection pools that connect to different databases.
#
# For example, suppose that you have 5 models, with the following hierarchy:
#
#   class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
#   end
#
#   class BankAccount < ActiveRecord::Base
#   end
#
#   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
#     establish_connection :library_db
#   end
#
#   class ScaryBook < Book
#   end
#
#   class GoodBook < Book
#   end
#
# And a database.yml that looked like this:
#
#   development:
#     database: my_application
#     host: localhost
#
#   library_db:
#     database: library
#     host: some.library.org
#
# Your primary database in the development environment is "my_application"
# but the Book model connects to a separate database called "library_db"
# (this can even be a database on a different machine).
#
# Book, ScaryBook and GoodBook will all use the same connection pool to
# "library_db" while Author, BankAccount, and any other models you create
# will use the default connection pool to "my_application".
#
# The various connection pools are managed by a single instance of
# ConnectionHandler accessible via ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.
# All Active Record models use this handler to determine the connection pool that they
# should use.
#
# The ConnectionHandler class is not coupled with the Active models, as it has no knowledge
# about the model. The model needs to pass a specification name to the handler,
# in order to look up the correct connection pool.

# Connection pool base class for managing Active Record database
# connections.
#
# == Introduction
#
# A connection pool synchronizes thread access to a limited number of
# database connections. The basic idea is that each thread checks out a
# database connection from the pool, uses that connection, and checks the
# connection back in. ConnectionPool is completely thread-safe, and will
# ensure that a connection cannot be used by two threads at the same time,
# as long as ConnectionPool's contract is correctly followed. It will also
# handle cases in which there are more threads than connections: if all
# connections have been checked out, and a thread tries to checkout a
# connection anyway, then ConnectionPool will wait until some other thread
# has checked in a connection.
#
# == Obtaining (checking out) a connection
#
# Connections can be obtained and used from a connection pool in several
# ways:
#
# 1. Simply use {ActiveRecord::Base.connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling.connection]
#    as with Active Record 2.1 and
#    earlier (pre-connection-pooling). Eventually, when you're done with
#    the connection(s) and wish it to be returned to the pool, you call
#    {ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionHandler#clear_active_connections!].
#    This will be the default behavior for Active Record when used in conjunction with
#    Action Pack's request handling cycle.
# 2. Manually check out a connection from the pool with
#    {ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkout}[rdoc-ref:#checkout]. You are responsible for
#    returning this connection to the pool when finished by calling
#    {ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkin(connection)}[rdoc-ref:#checkin].
# 3. Use {ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection(&block)}[rdoc-ref:#with_connection], which
#    obtains a connection, yields it as the sole argument to the block,
#    and returns it to the pool after the block completes.
#
# Connections in the pool are actually AbstractAdapter objects (or objects
# compatible with AbstractAdapter's interface).
#
# == Options
#
# There are several connection-pooling-related options that you can add to
# your database connection configuration:
#
# * +pool+: maximum number of connections the pool may manage (default 5).
# * +idle_timeout+: number of seconds that a connection will be kept
#   unused in the pool before it is automatically disconnected (default
#   300 seconds). Set this to zero to keep connections forever.
# * +checkout_timeout+: number of seconds to wait for a connection to
#   become available before giving up and raising a timeout error (default
#   5 seconds).
#
# --
# Synchronization policy:
# * all public methods can be called outside +synchronize+
# * access to these instance variables needs to be in +synchronize+:
#   * @connections
#   * @now_connecting
# * private methods that require being called in a +synchronize+ blocks
#   are now explicitly documented

  # Runs the given block in a database transaction, and returns the result
  # of the block.
  #
  # == Nested transactions support
  #
  # Most databases don't support true nested transactions. At the time of
  # writing, the only database that supports true nested transactions that
  # we're aware of, is MS-SQL.
  #
  # In order to get around this problem, #transaction will emulate the effect
  # of nested transactions, by using savepoints:
  # https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/savepoint.html
  # Savepoints are supported by MySQL and PostgreSQL. SQLite3 version >= '3.6.8'
  # supports savepoints.
  #
  # It is safe to call this method if a database transaction is already open,
  # i.e. if #transaction is called within another #transaction block. In case
  # of a nested call, #transaction will behave as follows:
  #
  # - The block will be run without doing anything. All database statements
  #   that happen within the block are effectively appended to the already
  #   open database transaction.
  # - However, if +:requires_new+ is set, the block will be wrapped in a
  #   database savepoint acting as a sub-transaction.
  #
  # === Caveats
  #
  # MySQL doesn't support DDL transactions. If you perform a DDL operation,
  # then any created savepoints will be automatically released. For example,
  # if you've created a savepoint, then you execute a CREATE TABLE statement,
  # then the savepoint that was created will be automatically released.
  #
  # This means that, on MySQL, you shouldn't execute DDL operations inside
  # a #transaction call that you know might create a savepoint. Otherwise,
  # #transaction will raise exceptions when it tries to release the
  # already-automatically-released savepoints:
  #
  #   Model.connection.transaction do  # BEGIN
  #     Model.connection.transaction(requires_new: true) do  # CREATE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
  #       Model.connection.create_table(...)
  #       # active_record_1 now automatically released
  #     end  # RELEASE SAVEPOINT active_record_1  <--- BOOM! database error!
  #   end
  #
  # == Transaction isolation
  #
  # If your database supports setting the isolation level for a transaction, you can set
  # it like so:
  #
  #   Post.transaction(isolation: :serializable) do
  #     # ...
  #   end
  #
  # Valid isolation levels are:
  #
  # * <tt>:read_uncommitted</tt>
  # * <tt>:read_committed</tt>
  # * <tt>:repeatable_read</tt>
  # * <tt>:serializable</tt>
  #
  # You should consult the documentation for your database to understand the
  # semantics of these different levels:
  #
  # * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/transaction-iso.html
  # * https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html
  #
  # An ActiveRecord::TransactionIsolationError will be raised if:
  #
  # * The adapter does not support setting the isolation level
  # * You are joining an existing open transaction
  # * You are creating a nested (savepoint) transaction
  #
  # The mysql2 and postgresql adapters support setting the transaction
  # isolation level.

  # Add a new +type+ column named +column_name+ to +table_name+.
  #
  # The +type+ parameter is normally one of the migrations native types,
  # which is one of the following:
  # <tt>:primary_key</tt>, <tt>:string</tt>, <tt>:text</tt>,
  # <tt>:integer</tt>, <tt>:bigint</tt>, <tt>:float</tt>, <tt>:decimal</tt>, <tt>:numeric</tt>,
  # <tt>:datetime</tt>, <tt>:time</tt>, <tt>:date</tt>,
  # <tt>:binary</tt>, <tt>:boolean</tt>.
  #
  # You may use a type not in this list as long as it is supported by your
  # database (for example, "polygon" in MySQL), but this will not be database
  # agnostic and should usually be avoided.
  #
  # Available options are (none of these exists by default):
  # * <tt>:limit</tt> -
  #   Requests a maximum column length. This is the number of characters for a <tt>:string</tt> column
  #   and number of bytes for <tt>:text</tt>, <tt>:binary</tt> and <tt>:integer</tt> columns.
  #   This option is ignored by some backends.
  # * <tt>:default</tt> -
  #   The column's default value. Use +nil+ for +NULL+.
  # * <tt>:null</tt> -
  #   Allows or disallows +NULL+ values in the column.
  # * <tt>:precision</tt> -
  #   Specifies the precision for the <tt>:decimal</tt> and <tt>:numeric</tt> columns.
  # * <tt>:scale</tt> -
  #   Specifies the scale for the <tt>:decimal</tt> and <tt>:numeric</tt> columns.
  # * <tt>:comment</tt> -
  #   Specifies the comment for the column. This option is ignored by some backends.
  #
  # Note: The precision is the total number of significant digits,
  # and the scale is the number of digits that can be stored following
  # the decimal point. For example, the number 123.45 has a precision of 5
  # and a scale of 2. A decimal with a precision of 5 and a scale of 2 can
  # range from -999.99 to 999.99.
  #
  # Please be aware of different RDBMS implementations behavior with
  # <tt>:decimal</tt> columns:
  # * The SQL standard says the default scale should be 0, <tt>:scale</tt> <=
  #   <tt>:precision</tt>, and makes no comments about the requirements of
  #   <tt>:precision</tt>.
  # * MySQL: <tt>:precision</tt> [1..63], <tt>:scale</tt> [0..30].
  #   Default is (10,0).
  # * PostgreSQL: <tt>:precision</tt> [1..infinity],
  #   <tt>:scale</tt> [0..infinity]. No default.
  # * SQLite3: No restrictions on <tt>:precision</tt> and <tt>:scale</tt>,
  #   but the maximum supported <tt>:precision</tt> is 16. No default.
  # * Oracle: <tt>:precision</tt> [1..38], <tt>:scale</tt> [-84..127].
  #   Default is (38,0).
  # * DB2: <tt>:precision</tt> [1..63], <tt>:scale</tt> [0..62].
  #   Default unknown.
  # * SqlServer: <tt>:precision</tt> [1..38], <tt>:scale</tt> [0..38].
  #   Default (38,0).

  # Creates a new table with the name +table_name+. +table_name+ may either
  # be a String or a Symbol.
  #
  # There are two ways to work with #create_table. You can use the block
  # form or the regular form, like this:
  #
  # === Block form
  #
  #   # create_table() passes a TableDefinition object to the block.
  #   # This form will not only create the table, but also columns for the
  #   # table.
  #
  #   create_table(:suppliers) do |t|
  #     t.column :name, :string, limit: 60
  #     # Other fields here
  #   end
  #
  # === Block form, with shorthand
  #
  #   # You can also use the column types as method calls, rather than calling the column method.
  #   create_table(:suppliers) do |t|
  #     t.string :name, limit: 60
  #     # Other fields here
  #   end
  #
  # === Regular form
  #
  #   # Creates a table called 'suppliers' with no columns.
  #   create_table(:suppliers)
  #   # Add a column to 'suppliers'.
  #   add_column(:suppliers, :name, :string, {limit: 60})
  #
  # The +options+ hash can include the following keys:
  # [<tt>:id</tt>]
  #   Whether to automatically add a primary key column. Defaults to true.
  #   Join tables for {ActiveRecord::Base.has_and_belongs_to_many}[rdoc-ref:Associations::ClassMethods#has_and_belongs_to_many] should set it to false.
  #
  #   A Symbol can be used to specify the type of the generated primary key column.
  # [<tt>:primary_key</tt>]
  #   The name of the primary key, if one is to be added automatically.
  #   Defaults to +id+. If <tt>:id</tt> is false, then this option is ignored.
  #
  #   If an array is passed, a composite primary key will be created.
  #
  #   Note that Active Record models will automatically detect their
  #   primary key. This can be avoided by using
  #   {self.primary_key=}[rdoc-ref:AttributeMethods::PrimaryKey::ClassMethods#primary_key=] on the model
  #   to define the key explicitly.
  #
  # [<tt>:options</tt>]
  #   Any extra options you want appended to the table definition.
  # [<tt>:temporary</tt>]
  #   Make a temporary table.
  # [<tt>:force</tt>]
  #   Set to true to drop the table before creating it.
  #   Set to +:cascade+ to drop dependent objects as well.
  #   Defaults to false.
  # [<tt>:as</tt>]
  #   SQL to use to generate the table. When this option is used, the block is
  #   ignored, as are the <tt>:id</tt> and <tt>:primary_key</tt> options.
  #

  # * <tt>:index</tt> -
  #   Create an index for the column. Can be either <tt>true</tt> or an options hash.
  #
  # This method returns <tt>self</tt>.
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  #  # Assuming +td+ is an instance of TableDefinition
  #  td.column(:granted, :boolean, index: true)
  #
  # == Short-hand examples
  #
  # Instead of calling #column directly, you can also work with the short-hand definitions for the default types.
  # They use the type as the method name instead of as a parameter and allow for multiple columns to be defined
  # in a single statement.
  #
  # What can be written like this with the regular calls to column:
  #
  #   create_table :products do |t|
  #     t.column :shop_id,     :integer
  #     t.column :creator_id,  :integer
  #     t.column :item_number, :string
  #     t.column :name,        :string, default: "Untitled"
  #     t.column :value,       :string, default: "Untitled"
  #     t.column :created_at,  :datetime
  #     t.column :updated_at,  :datetime
  #   end
  #   add_index :products, :item_number
  #
  # can also be written as follows using the short-hand:
  #
  #   create_table :products do |t|
  #     t.integer :shop_id, :creator_id
  #     t.string  :item_number, index: true
  #     t.string  :name, :value, default: "Untitled"
  #     t.timestamps null: false
  #   end
  #
  # There's a short-hand method for each of the type values declared at the top. And then there's
  # TableDefinition#timestamps that'll add +created_at+ and +updated_at+ as datetimes.
  #
  # TableDefinition#references will add an appropriately-named _id column, plus a corresponding _type
  # column if the <tt>:polymorphic</tt> option is supplied. If <tt>:polymorphic</tt> is a hash of
  # options, these will be used when creating the <tt>_type</tt> column. The <tt>:index</tt> option
  # will also create an index, similar to calling {add_index}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionAdapters::SchemaStatements#add_index].
  # So what can be written like this:
  #
  #   create_table :taggings do |t|
  #     t.integer :tag_id, :tagger_id, :taggable_id
  #     t.string  :tagger_type
  #     t.string  :taggable_type, default: 'Photo'
  #   end
  #   add_index :taggings, :tag_id, name: 'index_taggings_on_tag_id'
  #   add_index :taggings, [:tagger_id, :tagger_type]
  #
  # Can also be written as follows using references:
  #
  #   create_table :taggings do |t|
  #     t.references :tag, index: { name: 'index_taggings_on_tag_id' }
  #     t.references :tagger, polymorphic: true, index: true
  #     t.references :taggable, polymorphic: { default: 'Photo' }

module ActiveRecord::CounterCache::ClassMethods
  # Decrement a numeric field by one, via a direct SQL update.
  #
  # This works the same as #increment_counter but reduces the column value by
  # 1 instead of increasing it.
  #
  # ==== Parameters
  #
  # * +counter_name+ - The name of the field that should be decremented.
  # * +id+ - The id of the object that should be decremented or an array of ids.
  # * <tt>:touch</tt> - Touch timestamp columns when updating.
  #   Pass +true+ to touch +updated_at+ and/or +updated_on+. Pass a symbol to
  #   touch that column or an array of symbols to touch just those ones.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   # Decrement the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
  #   DiscussionBoard.decrement_counter(:posts_count, 5)
  #
  #   # Decrement the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
  #   # and update the updated_at value.
  #   DiscussionBoard.decrement_counter(:posts_count, 5, touch: true)
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/counter_cache.rb:176
  def decrement_counter(counter_name, id, touch: T.unsafe(nil)); end

  # Increment a numeric field by one, via a direct SQL update.
  #
  # This method is used primarily for maintaining counter_cache columns that are
  # used to store aggregate values. For example, a +DiscussionBoard+ may cache
  # posts_count and comments_count to avoid running an SQL query to calculate the
  # number of posts and comments there are, each time it is displayed.
  #
  # ==== Parameters
  #
  # * +counter_name+ - The name of the field that should be incremented.
  # * +id+ - The id of the object that should be incremented or an array of ids.
  # * <tt>:touch</tt> - Touch timestamp columns when updating.
  #   Pass +true+ to touch +updated_at+ and/or +updated_on+. Pass a symbol to
  #   touch that column or an array of symbols to touch just those ones.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   # Increment the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
  #   DiscussionBoard.increment_counter(:posts_count, 5)
  #
  #   # Increment the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
  #   # and update the updated_at value.
  #   DiscussionBoard.increment_counter(:posts_count, 5, touch: true)
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/counter_cache.rb:151
  def increment_counter(counter_name, id, touch: T.unsafe(nil)); end

  # Resets one or more counter caches to their correct value using an SQL
  # count query. This is useful when adding new counter caches, or if the
  # counter has been corrupted or modified directly by SQL.
  #
  # ==== Parameters
  #
  # * +id+ - The id of the object you wish to reset a counter on.
  # * +counters+ - One or more association counters to reset. Association name or counter name can be given.
  # * <tt>:touch</tt> - Touch timestamp columns when updating.
  #   Pass +true+ to touch +updated_at+ and/or +updated_on+. Pass a symbol to
  #   touch that column or an array of symbols to touch just those ones.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   # For the Post with id #1, reset the comments_count
  #   Post.reset_counters(1, :comments)
  #
  #   # Like above, but also touch the +updated_at+ and/or +updated_on+
  #   # attributes.
  #   Post.reset_counters(1, :comments, touch: true)
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/counter_cache.rb:29
  def reset_counters(id, *counters, touch: T.unsafe(nil)); end

  # A generic "counter updater" implementation, intended primarily to be
  # used by #increment_counter and #decrement_counter, but which may also
  # be useful on its own. It simply does a direct SQL update for the record
  # with the given ID, altering the given hash of counters by the amount
  # given by the corresponding value:
  #
  # ==== Parameters
  #
  # * +id+ - The id of the object you wish to update a counter on or an array of ids.
  # * +counters+ - A Hash containing the names of the fields
  #   to update as keys and the amount to update the field by as values.
  # * <tt>:touch</tt> option - Touch timestamp columns when updating.
  #   If attribute names are passed, they are updated along with updated_at/on
  #   attributes.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   # For the Post with id of 5, decrement the comment_count by 1, and
  #   # increment the action_count by 1
  #   Post.update_counters 5, comment_count: -1, action_count: 1
  #   # Executes the following SQL:

  #   #        action_count = COALESCE(action_count, 0) + 1
  #   #  WHERE id = 5
  #
  #   # For the Posts with id of 10 and 15, increment the comment_count by 1
  #   Post.update_counters [10, 15], comment_count: 1
  #   # Executes the following SQL:
  #   # UPDATE posts
  #   #    SET comment_count = COALESCE(comment_count, 0) + 1
  #   #  WHERE id IN (10, 15)
  #
  #   # For the Posts with id of 10 and 15, increment the comment_count by 1
  #   # and update the updated_at value for each counter.

# Declare an enum attribute where the values map to integers in the database,
# but can be queried by name. Example:
#
#   class Conversation < ActiveRecord::Base
#     enum status: [ :active, :archived ]
#   end
#
#   # conversation.update! status: 0
#   conversation.active!
#   conversation.active? # => true
#   conversation.status  # => "active"
#
#   # conversation.update! status: 1
#   conversation.archived!
#   conversation.archived? # => true
#   conversation.status    # => "archived"
#
#   # conversation.status = 1
#   conversation.status = "archived"
#
#   conversation.status = nil
#   conversation.status.nil? # => true
#   conversation.status      # => nil
#
# Scopes based on the allowed values of the enum field will be provided
# as well. With the above example:
#
#   Conversation.active
#   Conversation.archived
#
# Of course, you can also query them directly if the scopes don't fit your
# needs:
#
#   Conversation.where(status: [:active, :archived])
#   Conversation.where.not(status: :active)
#
# You can set the default value from the database declaration, like:
#
#   create_table :conversations do |t|
#     t.column :status, :integer, default: 0
#   end
#
# Good practice is to let the first declared status be the default.
#
# Finally, it's also possible to explicitly map the relation between attribute and
# database integer with a hash:
#
#   class Conversation < ActiveRecord::Base
#     enum status: { active: 0, archived: 1 }
#   end
#
# Note that when an array is used, the implicit mapping from the values to database
# integers is derived from the order the values appear in the array. In the example,
# <tt>:active</tt> is mapped to +0+ as it's the first element, and <tt>:archived</tt>
# is mapped to +1+. In general, the +i+-th element is mapped to <tt>i-1</tt> in the
# database.
#
# Therefore, once a value is added to the enum array, its position in the array must
# be maintained, and new values should only be added to the end of the array. To
# remove unused values, the explicit hash syntax should be used.
#
# In rare circumstances you might need to access the mapping directly.
# The mappings are exposed through a class method with the pluralized attribute
# name, which return the mapping in a +HashWithIndifferentAccess+:
#
#   Conversation.statuses[:active]    # => 0
#   Conversation.statuses["archived"] # => 1
#
# Use that class method when you need to know the ordinal value of an enum.
# For example, you can use that when manually building SQL strings:
#
#   Conversation.where("status <> ?", Conversation.statuses[:archived])
#
# You can use the +:_prefix+ or +:_suffix+ options when you need to define
# multiple enums with same values. If the passed value is +true+, the methods
# are prefixed/suffixed with the name of the enum. It is also possible to
# supply a custom value:
#
#   class Conversation < ActiveRecord::Base
#     enum status: [:active, :archived], _suffix: true
#     enum comments_status: [:active, :inactive], _prefix: :comments
#   end
#
# With the above example, the bang and predicate methods along with the
# associated scopes are now prefixed and/or suffixed accordingly:
#
#   conversation.active_status!
#   conversation.archived_status? # => false
#
#   conversation.comments_inactive!
#   conversation.comments_active? # => false

  # Find by id - This can either be a specific id (1), a list of ids (1, 5, 6), or an array of ids ([5, 6, 10]).

  # ==== Find with lock
  #
  # Example for find with a lock: Imagine two concurrent transactions:
  # each will read <tt>person.visits == 2</tt>, add 1 to it, and save, resulting
  # in two saves of <tt>person.visits = 3</tt>. By locking the row, the second
  # transaction has to wait until the first is finished; we get the
  # expected <tt>person.visits == 4</tt>.
  #
  #   Person.transaction do
  #     person = Person.lock(true).find(1)
  #     person.visits += 1
  #     person.save!
  #   end
  #
  # ==== Variations of #find
  #

  #   # returns the first item or nil.
  #
  #   Person.find_or_initialize_by(name: 'Spartacus', rating: 4)
  #   # returns the first item or returns a new instance (requires you call .save to persist against the database).
  #
  #   Person.find_or_create_by(name: 'Spartacus', rating: 4)
  #   # returns the first item or creates it and returns it.
  #
  # ==== Alternatives for #find
  #
  #   Person.where(name: 'Spartacus', rating: 4).exists?(conditions = :none)
  #   # returns a boolean indicating if any record with the given conditions exist.
  #
  #   Person.where(name: 'Spartacus', rating: 4).select("field1, field2, field3")
  #   # returns a chainable list of instances with only the mentioned fields.
  #
  #   Person.where(name: 'Spartacus', rating: 4).ids
  #   # returns an Array of ids.
  #
  #   Person.where(name: 'Spartacus', rating: 4).pluck(:field1, :field2)

# \Fixtures are a way of organizing data that you want to test against; in short, sample data.
#
# They are stored in YAML files, one file per model, which are placed in the directory
# appointed by <tt>ActiveSupport::TestCase.fixture_path=(path)</tt> (this is automatically
# configured for Rails, so you can just put your files in <tt><your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/</tt>).
# The fixture file ends with the +.yml+ file extension, for example:
# <tt><your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/web_sites.yml</tt>).
#
# The format of a fixture file looks like this:
#
#   rubyonrails:
#     id: 1
#     name: Ruby on Rails
#     url: http://www.rubyonrails.org
#
#   google:
#     id: 2
#     name: Google
#     url: http://www.google.com
#
# This fixture file includes two fixtures. Each YAML fixture (ie. record) is given a name and
# is followed by an indented list of key/value pairs in the "key: value" format. Records are
# separated by a blank line for your viewing pleasure.
#
# Note: Fixtures are unordered. If you want ordered fixtures, use the omap YAML type.
# See http://yaml.org/type/omap.html
# for the specification. You will need ordered fixtures when you have foreign key constraints
# on keys in the same table. This is commonly needed for tree structures. Example:
#
#    --- !omap
#    - parent:
#        id:         1
#        parent_id:  NULL
#        title:      Parent
#    - child:
#        id:         2
#        parent_id:  1
#        title:      Child
#
# = Using Fixtures in Test Cases
#
# Since fixtures are a testing construct, we use them in our unit and functional tests. There
# are two ways to use the fixtures, but first let's take a look at a sample unit test:
#
#   require 'test_helper'
#
#   class WebSiteTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
#     test "web_site_count" do
#       assert_equal 2, WebSite.count
#     end
#   end
#
# By default, +test_helper.rb+ will load all of your fixtures into your test
# database, so this test will succeed.
#
# The testing environment will automatically load all the fixtures into the database before each
# test. To ensure consistent data, the environment deletes the fixtures before running the load.
#
# In addition to being available in the database, the fixture's data may also be accessed by
# using a special dynamic method, which has the same name as the model.
#
# Passing in a fixture name to this dynamic method returns the fixture matching this name:
#
#   test "find one" do
#     assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", web_sites(:rubyonrails).name
#   end
#
# Passing in multiple fixture names returns all fixtures matching these names:
#
#   test "find all by name" do
#     assert_equal 2, web_sites(:rubyonrails, :google).length
#   end
#
# Passing in no arguments returns all fixtures:
#
#   test "find all" do
#     assert_equal 2, web_sites.length
#   end
#
# Passing in any fixture name that does not exist will raise <tt>StandardError</tt>:
#
#   test "find by name that does not exist" do
#     assert_raise(StandardError) { web_sites(:reddit) }
#   end
#
# Alternatively, you may enable auto-instantiation of the fixture data. For instance, take the
# following tests:
#
#   test "find_alt_method_1" do
#     assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", @web_sites['rubyonrails']['name']
#   end
#
#   test "find_alt_method_2" do
#     assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", @rubyonrails.name
#   end
#
# In order to use these methods to access fixtured data within your test cases, you must specify one of the
# following in your ActiveSupport::TestCase-derived class:
#
# - to fully enable instantiated fixtures (enable alternate methods #1 and #2 above)
#     self.use_instantiated_fixtures = true
#
# - create only the hash for the fixtures, do not 'find' each instance (enable alternate method #1 only)
#     self.use_instantiated_fixtures = :no_instances
#
# Using either of these alternate methods incurs a performance hit, as the fixtured data must be fully
# traversed in the database to create the fixture hash and/or instance variables. This is expensive for
# large sets of fixtured data.
#
# = Dynamic fixtures with ERB
#
# Sometimes you don't care about the content of the fixtures as much as you care about the volume.
# In these cases, you can mix ERB in with your YAML fixtures to create a bunch of fixtures for load
# testing, like:
#
#   <% 1.upto(1000) do |i| %>
#   fix_<%= i %>:
#     id: <%= i %>
#     name: guy_<%= i %>
#   <% end %>
#
# This will create 1000 very simple fixtures.
#
# Using ERB, you can also inject dynamic values into your fixtures with inserts like
# <tt><%= Date.today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %></tt>.
# This is however a feature to be used with some caution. The point of fixtures are that they're
# stable units of predictable sample data. If you feel that you need to inject dynamic values, then
# perhaps you should reexamine whether your application is properly testable. Hence, dynamic values
# in fixtures are to be considered a code smell.
#
# Helper methods defined in a fixture will not be available in other fixtures, to prevent against
# unwanted inter-test dependencies. Methods used by multiple fixtures should be defined in a module
# that is included in ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.context_class.
#
# - define a helper method in <tt>test_helper.rb</tt>
#     module FixtureFileHelpers
#       def file_sha(path)
#         Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(File.read(Rails.root.join('test/fixtures', path)))
#       end
#     end
#     ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.context_class.include FixtureFileHelpers
#
# - use the helper method in a fixture
#     photo:
#       name: kitten.png
#       sha: <%= file_sha 'files/kitten.png' %>
#
# = Transactional Tests
#
# Test cases can use begin+rollback to isolate their changes to the database instead of having to
# delete+insert for every test case.
#
#   class FooTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
#     self.use_transactional_tests = true
#
#     test "godzilla" do
#       assert_not_empty Foo.all
#       Foo.destroy_all
#       assert_empty Foo.all
#     end
#
#     test "godzilla aftermath" do
#       assert_not_empty Foo.all
#     end
#   end
#
# If you preload your test database with all fixture data (probably in the rake task) and use
# transactional tests, then you may omit all fixtures declarations in your test cases since
# all the data's already there and every case rolls back its changes.
#
# In order to use instantiated fixtures with preloaded data, set +self.pre_loaded_fixtures+ to
# true. This will provide access to fixture data for every table that has been loaded through
# fixtures (depending on the value of +use_instantiated_fixtures+).
#
# When *not* to use transactional tests:
#
# 1. You're testing whether a transaction works correctly. Nested transactions don't commit until
#    all parent transactions commit, particularly, the fixtures transaction which is begun in setup
#    and rolled back in teardown. Thus, you won't be able to verify
#    the results of your transaction until Active Record supports nested transactions or savepoints (in progress).
# 2. Your database does not support transactions. Every Active Record database supports transactions except MySQL MyISAM.
#    Use InnoDB, MaxDB, or NDB instead.
#
# = Advanced Fixtures
#
# Fixtures that don't specify an ID get some extra features:
#
# * Stable, autogenerated IDs
# * Label references for associations (belongs_to, has_one, has_many)
# * HABTM associations as inline lists
#
# There are some more advanced features available even if the id is specified:
#
# * Autofilled timestamp columns
# * Fixture label interpolation
# * Support for YAML defaults
#
# == Stable, Autogenerated IDs
#
# Here, have a monkey fixture:
#
#   george:
#     id: 1
#     name: George the Monkey
#
#   reginald:
#     id: 2
#     name: Reginald the Pirate
#
# Each of these fixtures has two unique identifiers: one for the database
# and one for the humans. Why don't we generate the primary key instead?
# Hashing each fixture's label yields a consistent ID:
#
#   george: # generated id: 503576764

#
#   reginald: # generated id: 324201669
#     name: Reginald the Pirate
#
# Active Record looks at the fixture's model class, discovers the correct
# primary key, and generates it right before inserting the fixture
# into the database.
#
# The generated ID for a given label is constant, so we can discover
# any fixture's ID without loading anything, as long as we know the label.
#
# == Label references for associations (belongs_to, has_one, has_many)
#
# Specifying foreign keys in fixtures can be very fragile, not to
# mention difficult to read. Since Active Record can figure out the ID of
# any fixture from its label, you can specify FK's by label instead of ID.
#
# === belongs_to
#
# Let's break out some more monkeys and pirates.
#
#   ### in pirates.yml
#
#   reginald:
#     id: 1
#     name: Reginald the Pirate
#     monkey_id: 1
#
#   ### in monkeys.yml
#
#   george:
#     id: 1
#     name: George the Monkey
#     pirate_id: 1
#
# Add a few more monkeys and pirates and break this into multiple files,
# and it gets pretty hard to keep track of what's going on. Let's
# use labels instead of IDs:
#
#   ### in pirates.yml
#
#   reginald:
#     name: Reginald the Pirate
#     monkey: george
#
#   ### in monkeys.yml
#
#   george:
#     name: George the Monkey
#     pirate: reginald
#
# Pow! All is made clear. Active Record reflects on the fixture's model class,
# finds all the +belongs_to+ associations, and allows you to specify
# a target *label* for the *association* (monkey: george) rather than
# a target *id* for the *FK* (<tt>monkey_id: 1</tt>).
#
# ==== Polymorphic belongs_to
#
# Supporting polymorphic relationships is a little bit more complicated, since
# Active Record needs to know what type your association is pointing at. Something
# like this should look familiar:
#
#   ### in fruit.rb
#
#   belongs_to :eater, polymorphic: true
#
#   ### in fruits.yml
#
#   apple:
#     id: 1
#     name: apple
#     eater_id: 1
#     eater_type: Monkey
#
# Can we do better? You bet!
#
#   apple:
#     eater: george (Monkey)
#
# Just provide the polymorphic target type and Active Record will take care of the rest.
#
# === has_and_belongs_to_many
#
# Time to give our monkey some fruit.
#
#   ### in monkeys.yml
#
#   george:
#     id: 1
#     name: George the Monkey
#
#   ### in fruits.yml
#
#   apple:
#     id: 1
#     name: apple
#
#   orange:
#     id: 2
#     name: orange
#
#   grape:
#     id: 3
#     name: grape
#
#   ### in fruits_monkeys.yml
#
#   apple_george:
#     fruit_id: 1
#     monkey_id: 1
#
#   orange_george:
#     fruit_id: 2
#     monkey_id: 1
#
#   grape_george:
#     fruit_id: 3
#     monkey_id: 1
#
# Let's make the HABTM fixture go away.
#
#   ### in monkeys.yml
#
#   george:
#     id: 1
#     name: George the Monkey
#     fruits: apple, orange, grape
#
#   ### in fruits.yml
#
#   apple:
#     name: apple
#
#   orange:
#     name: orange
#
#   grape:
#     name: grape
#
# Zap! No more fruits_monkeys.yml file. We've specified the list of fruits
# on George's fixture, but we could've just as easily specified a list
# of monkeys on each fruit. As with +belongs_to+, Active Record reflects on
# the fixture's model class and discovers the +has_and_belongs_to_many+
# associations.
#
# == Autofilled Timestamp Columns
#
# If your table/model specifies any of Active Record's
# standard timestamp columns (+created_at+, +created_on+, +updated_at+, +updated_on+),
# they will automatically be set to <tt>Time.now</tt>.
#
# If you've set specific values, they'll be left alone.
#
# == Fixture label interpolation
#
# The label of the current fixture is always available as a column value:
#
#   geeksomnia:
#     name: Geeksomnia's Account
#     subdomain: $LABEL
#     email: $LABEL@email.com
#
# Also, sometimes (like when porting older join table fixtures) you'll need
# to be able to get a hold of the identifier for a given label. ERB
# to the rescue:
#
#   george_reginald:
#     monkey_id: <%= ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.identify(:reginald) %>
#     pirate_id: <%= ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.identify(:george) %>
#
# == Support for YAML defaults
#
# You can set and reuse defaults in your fixtures YAML file.
# This is the same technique used in the +database.yml+ file to specify
# defaults:
#
#   DEFAULTS: &DEFAULTS
#     created_on: <%= 3.weeks.ago.to_s(:db) %>
#
#   first:
#     name: Smurf
#     <<: *DEFAULTS
#
#   second:
#     name: Fraggle
#     <<: *DEFAULTS
#
# Any fixture labeled "DEFAULTS" is safely ignored.
#
# == Configure the fixture model class
#
# It's possible to set the fixture's model class directly in the YAML file.
# This is helpful when fixtures are loaded outside tests and
# +set_fixture_class+ is not available (e.g.
# when running <tt>rails db:fixtures:load</tt>).
#
#   _fixture:
#     model_class: User
#   david:
#     name: David
#
# Any fixtures labeled "_fixture" are safely ignored.

# == Single table inheritance
#
# Active Record allows inheritance by storing the name of the class in a column that by
# default is named "type" (can be changed by overwriting <tt>Base.inheritance_column</tt>).
# This means that an inheritance looking like this:
#
#   class Company < ActiveRecord::Base; end
#   class Firm < Company; end
#   class Client < Company; end
#   class PriorityClient < Client; end
#
# When you do <tt>Firm.create(name: "37signals")</tt>, this record will be saved in
# the companies table with type = "Firm". You can then fetch this row again using
# <tt>Company.where(name: '37signals').first</tt> and it will return a Firm object.
#
# Be aware that because the type column is an attribute on the record every new
# subclass will instantly be marked as dirty and the type column will be included
# in the list of changed attributes on the record. This is different from non
# Single Table Inheritance(STI) classes:
#
#   Company.new.changed? # => false
#   Firm.new.changed?    # => true
#   Firm.new.changes     # => {"type"=>["","Firm"]}
#
# If you don't have a type column defined in your table, single-table inheritance won't
# be triggered. In that case, it'll work just like normal subclasses with no special magic
# for differentiating between them or reloading the right type with find.
#
# Note, all the attributes for all the cases are kept in the same table. Read more:

# == What is Optimistic Locking
#
# Optimistic locking allows multiple users to access the same record for edits, and assumes a minimum of
# conflicts with the data. It does this by checking whether another process has made changes to a record since
# it was opened, an <tt>ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError</tt> exception is thrown if that has occurred
# and the update is ignored.
#
# Check out <tt>ActiveRecord::Locking::Pessimistic</tt> for an alternative.
#
# == Usage
#
# Active Record supports optimistic locking if the +lock_version+ field is present. Each update to the
# record increments the +lock_version+ column and the locking facilities ensure that records instantiated twice
# will let the last one saved raise a +StaleObjectError+ if the first was also updated. Example:
#
#   p1 = Person.find(1)
#   p2 = Person.find(1)
#
#   p1.first_name = "Michael"
#   p1.save
#
#   p2.first_name = "should fail"
#   p2.save # Raises an ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError
#
# Optimistic locking will also check for stale data when objects are destroyed. Example:
#
#   p1 = Person.find(1)
#   p2 = Person.find(1)
#
#   p1.first_name = "Michael"
#   p1.save
#
#   p2.destroy # Raises an ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError
#
# You're then responsible for dealing with the conflict by rescuing the exception and either rolling back, merging,
# or otherwise apply the business logic needed to resolve the conflict.
#
# This locking mechanism will function inside a single Ruby process. To make it work across all
# web requests, the recommended approach is to add +lock_version+ as a hidden field to your form.
#
# This behavior can be turned off by setting <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.lock_optimistically = false</tt>.
# To override the name of the +lock_version+ column, set the <tt>locking_column</tt> class attribute:
#
#   class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
#     self.locking_column = :lock_person
#   end

  # sub class being decorated. As such, changes to `lock_optimistically`, or
  # `locking_column` would not be picked up.

ActiveRecord::Locking::Optimistic::ClassMethods::DEFAULT_LOCKING_COLUMN = T.let(T.unsafe(nil), String)

# Locking::Pessimistic provides support for row-level locking using
# SELECT ... FOR UPDATE and other lock types.
#
# Chain <tt>ActiveRecord::Base#find</tt> to <tt>ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#lock</tt> to obtain an exclusive
# lock on the selected rows:
#   # select * from accounts where id=1 for update
#   Account.lock.find(1)
#
# Call <tt>lock('some locking clause')</tt> to use a database-specific locking clause
# of your own such as 'LOCK IN SHARE MODE' or 'FOR UPDATE NOWAIT'. Example:
#
#   Account.transaction do
#     # select * from accounts where name = 'shugo' limit 1 for update
#     shugo = Account.where("name = 'shugo'").lock(true).first
#     yuko = Account.where("name = 'yuko'").lock(true).first
#     shugo.balance -= 100
#     shugo.save!
#     yuko.balance += 100
#     yuko.save!
#   end
#
# You can also use <tt>ActiveRecord::Base#lock!</tt> method to lock one record by id.
# This may be better if you don't need to lock every row. Example:
#
#   Account.transaction do
#     # select * from accounts where ...
#     accounts = Account.where(...)
#     account1 = accounts.detect { |account| ... }
#     account2 = accounts.detect { |account| ... }
#     # select * from accounts where id=? for update
#     account1.lock!
#     account2.lock!
#     account1.balance -= 100
#     account1.save!
#     account2.balance += 100
#     account2.save!
#   end
#
# You can start a transaction and acquire the lock in one go by calling
# <tt>with_lock</tt> with a block. The block is called from within
# a transaction, the object is already locked. Example:
#
#   account = Account.first
#   account.with_lock do
#     # This block is called within a transaction,
#     # account is already locked.
#     account.balance -= 100
#     account.save!
#   end

# = Active Record Migrations
#
# Migrations can manage the evolution of a schema used by several physical
# databases. It's a solution to the common problem of adding a field to make
# a new feature work in your local database, but being unsure of how to
# push that change to other developers and to the production server. With
# migrations, you can describe the transformations in self-contained classes
# that can be checked into version control systems and executed against
# another database that might be one, two, or five versions behind.
#
# Example of a simple migration:
#
#   class AddSsl < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     def up
#       add_column :accounts, :ssl_enabled, :boolean, default: true
#     end
#
#     def down
#       remove_column :accounts, :ssl_enabled
#     end
#   end
#
# This migration will add a boolean flag to the accounts table and remove it
# if you're backing out of the migration. It shows how all migrations have
# two methods +up+ and +down+ that describes the transformations
# required to implement or remove the migration. These methods can consist
# of both the migration specific methods like +add_column+ and +remove_column+,
# but may also contain regular Ruby code for generating data needed for the
# transformations.
#
# Example of a more complex migration that also needs to initialize data:
#
#   class AddSystemSettings < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     def up
#       create_table :system_settings do |t|
#         t.string  :name
#         t.string  :label
#         t.text    :value
#         t.string  :type
#         t.integer :position
#       end
#
#       SystemSetting.create  name:  'notice',
#                             label: 'Use notice?',
#                             value: 1
#     end
#
#     def down
#       drop_table :system_settings
#     end
#   end
#
# This migration first adds the +system_settings+ table, then creates the very
# first row in it using the Active Record model that relies on the table. It
# also uses the more advanced +create_table+ syntax where you can specify a
# complete table schema in one block call.
#
# == Available transformations
#
# === Creation
#
# * <tt>create_join_table(table_1, table_2, options)</tt>: Creates a join
#   table having its name as the lexical order of the first two
#   arguments. See
#   ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SchemaStatements#create_join_table for
#   details.
# * <tt>create_table(name, options)</tt>: Creates a table called +name+ and
#   makes the table object available to a block that can then add columns to it,
#   following the same format as +add_column+. See example above. The options hash
#   is for fragments like "DEFAULT CHARSET=UTF-8" that are appended to the create
#   table definition.
# * <tt>add_column(table_name, column_name, type, options)</tt>: Adds a new column
#   to the table called +table_name+
#   named +column_name+ specified to be one of the following types:
#   <tt>:string</tt>, <tt>:text</tt>, <tt>:integer</tt>, <tt>:float</tt>,
#   <tt>:decimal</tt>, <tt>:datetime</tt>, <tt>:timestamp</tt>, <tt>:time</tt>,
#   <tt>:date</tt>, <tt>:binary</tt>, <tt>:boolean</tt>. A default value can be
#   specified by passing an +options+ hash like <tt>{ default: 11 }</tt>.
#   Other options include <tt>:limit</tt> and <tt>:null</tt> (e.g.
#   <tt>{ limit: 50, null: false }</tt>) -- see
#   ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::TableDefinition#column for details.
# * <tt>add_foreign_key(from_table, to_table, options)</tt>: Adds a new
#   foreign key. +from_table+ is the table with the key column, +to_table+ contains
#   the referenced primary key.
# * <tt>add_index(table_name, column_names, options)</tt>: Adds a new index
#   with the name of the column. Other options include
#   <tt>:name</tt>, <tt>:unique</tt> (e.g.
#   <tt>{ name: 'users_name_index', unique: true }</tt>) and <tt>:order</tt>
#   (e.g. <tt>{ order: { name: :desc } }</tt>).
# * <tt>add_reference(:table_name, :reference_name)</tt>: Adds a new column
#   +reference_name_id+ by default an integer. See
#   ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SchemaStatements#add_reference for details.
# * <tt>add_timestamps(table_name, options)</tt>: Adds timestamps (+created_at+
#   and +updated_at+) columns to +table_name+.
#
# === Modification
#
# * <tt>change_column(table_name, column_name, type, options)</tt>:  Changes
#   the column to a different type using the same parameters as add_column.
# * <tt>change_column_default(table_name, column_name, default_or_changes)</tt>:
#   Sets a default value for +column_name+ defined by +default_or_changes+ on
#   +table_name+. Passing a hash containing <tt>:from</tt> and <tt>:to</tt>
#   as +default_or_changes+ will make this change reversible in the migration.
# * <tt>change_column_null(table_name, column_name, null, default = nil)</tt>:
#   Sets or removes a +NOT NULL+ constraint on +column_name+. The +null+ flag
#   indicates whether the value can be +NULL+. See
#   ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SchemaStatements#change_column_null for
#   details.
# * <tt>change_table(name, options)</tt>: Allows to make column alterations to
#   the table called +name+. It makes the table object available to a block that
#   can then add/remove columns, indexes or foreign keys to it.
# * <tt>rename_column(table_name, column_name, new_column_name)</tt>: Renames
#   a column but keeps the type and content.
# * <tt>rename_index(table_name, old_name, new_name)</tt>: Renames an index.
# * <tt>rename_table(old_name, new_name)</tt>: Renames the table called +old_name+
#   to +new_name+.
#
# === Deletion
#
# * <tt>drop_table(name)</tt>: Drops the table called +name+.
# * <tt>drop_join_table(table_1, table_2, options)</tt>: Drops the join table
#   specified by the given arguments.
# * <tt>remove_column(table_name, column_name, type, options)</tt>: Removes the column
#   named +column_name+ from the table called +table_name+.
# * <tt>remove_columns(table_name, *column_names)</tt>: Removes the given
#   columns from the table definition.
# * <tt>remove_foreign_key(from_table, options_or_to_table)</tt>: Removes the
#   given foreign key from the table called +table_name+.
# * <tt>remove_index(table_name, column: column_names)</tt>: Removes the index
#   specified by +column_names+.
# * <tt>remove_index(table_name, name: index_name)</tt>: Removes the index
#   specified by +index_name+.
# * <tt>remove_reference(table_name, ref_name, options)</tt>: Removes the
#   reference(s) on +table_name+ specified by +ref_name+.
# * <tt>remove_timestamps(table_name, options)</tt>: Removes the timestamp
#   columns (+created_at+ and +updated_at+) from the table definition.
#
# == Irreversible transformations
#
# Some transformations are destructive in a manner that cannot be reversed.
# Migrations of that kind should raise an <tt>ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration</tt>
# exception in their +down+ method.
#
# == Running migrations from within Rails
#
# The Rails package has several tools to help create and apply migrations.
#
# To generate a new migration, you can use
#   rails generate migration MyNewMigration
#
# where MyNewMigration is the name of your migration. The generator will
# create an empty migration file <tt>timestamp_my_new_migration.rb</tt>
# in the <tt>db/migrate/</tt> directory where <tt>timestamp</tt> is the
# UTC formatted date and time that the migration was generated.
#
# There is a special syntactic shortcut to generate migrations that add fields to a table.
#
#   rails generate migration add_fieldname_to_tablename fieldname:string
#
# This will generate the file <tt>timestamp_add_fieldname_to_tablename.rb</tt>, which will look like this:
#   class AddFieldnameToTablename < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     def change
#       add_column :tablenames, :fieldname, :string
#     end
#   end
#
# To run migrations against the currently configured database, use
# <tt>rails db:migrate</tt>. This will update the database by running all of the
# pending migrations, creating the <tt>schema_migrations</tt> table
# (see "About the schema_migrations table" section below) if missing. It will also
# invoke the db:schema:dump task, which will update your db/schema.rb file
# to match the structure of your database.
#
# To roll the database back to a previous migration version, use
# <tt>rails db:rollback VERSION=X</tt> where <tt>X</tt> is the version to which
# you wish to downgrade. Alternatively, you can also use the STEP option if you
# wish to rollback last few migrations. <tt>rails db:rollback STEP=2</tt> will rollback
# the latest two migrations.
#
# If any of the migrations throw an <tt>ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration</tt> exception,
# that step will fail and you'll have some manual work to do.
#
# == Database support
#
# Migrations are currently supported in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite,
# SQL Server, and Oracle (all supported databases except DB2).
#
# == More examples
#
# Not all migrations change the schema. Some just fix the data:
#
#   class RemoveEmptyTags < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     def up
#       Tag.all.each { |tag| tag.destroy if tag.pages.empty? }
#     end
#
#     def down
#       # not much we can do to restore deleted data
#       raise ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration, "Can't recover the deleted tags"
#     end
#   end
#
# Others remove columns when they migrate up instead of down:
#
#   class RemoveUnnecessaryItemAttributes < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     def up
#       remove_column :items, :incomplete_items_count
#       remove_column :items, :completed_items_count
#     end
#
#     def down
#       add_column :items, :incomplete_items_count
#       add_column :items, :completed_items_count
#     end
#   end
#
# And sometimes you need to do something in SQL not abstracted directly by migrations:
#
#   class MakeJoinUnique < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     def up
#       execute "ALTER TABLE `pages_linked_pages` ADD UNIQUE `page_id_linked_page_id` (`page_id`,`linked_page_id`)"
#     end
#
#     def down
#       execute "ALTER TABLE `pages_linked_pages` DROP INDEX `page_id_linked_page_id`"
#     end
#   end
#
# == Using a model after changing its table
#
# Sometimes you'll want to add a column in a migration and populate it
# immediately after. In that case, you'll need to make a call to
# <tt>Base#reset_column_information</tt> in order to ensure that the model has the
# latest column data from after the new column was added. Example:
#
#   class AddPeopleSalary < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     def up
#       add_column :people, :salary, :integer
#       Person.reset_column_information
#       Person.all.each do |p|
#         p.update_attribute :salary, SalaryCalculator.compute(p)
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
# == Controlling verbosity
#
# By default, migrations will describe the actions they are taking, writing
# them to the console as they happen, along with benchmarks describing how
# long each step took.
#
# You can quiet them down by setting ActiveRecord::Migration.verbose = false.
#
# You can also insert your own messages and benchmarks by using the +say_with_time+
# method:
#
#   def up
#     ...
#     say_with_time "Updating salaries..." do
#       Person.all.each do |p|
#         p.update_attribute :salary, SalaryCalculator.compute(p)
#       end
#     end
#     ...
#   end
#
# The phrase "Updating salaries..." would then be printed, along with the
# benchmark for the block when the block completes.
#
# == Timestamped Migrations
#
# By default, Rails generates migrations that look like:
#
#    20080717013526_your_migration_name.rb
#
# The prefix is a generation timestamp (in UTC).
#
# If you'd prefer to use numeric prefixes, you can turn timestamped migrations
# off by setting:
#
#    config.active_record.timestamped_migrations = false
#
# In application.rb.
#
# == Reversible Migrations
#
# Reversible migrations are migrations that know how to go +down+ for you.
# You simply supply the +up+ logic, and the Migration system figures out
# how to execute the down commands for you.
#
# To define a reversible migration, define the +change+ method in your
# migration like this:
#
#   class TenderloveMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     def change
#       create_table(:horses) do |t|
#         t.column :content, :text
#         t.column :remind_at, :datetime
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
# This migration will create the horses table for you on the way up, and
# automatically figure out how to drop the table on the way down.
#
# Some commands like +remove_column+ cannot be reversed.  If you care to
# define how to move up and down in these cases, you should define the +up+
# and +down+ methods as before.
#
# If a command cannot be reversed, an
# <tt>ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration</tt> exception will be raised when
# the migration is moving down.
#
# For a list of commands that are reversible, please see
# <tt>ActiveRecord::Migration::CommandRecorder</tt>.
#
# == Transactional Migrations
#
# If the database adapter supports DDL transactions, all migrations will
# automatically be wrapped in a transaction. There are queries that you
# can't execute inside a transaction though, and for these situations
# you can turn the automatic transactions off.
#
#   class ChangeEnum < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
#     disable_ddl_transaction!
#
#     def up
#       execute "ALTER TYPE model_size ADD VALUE 'new_value'"
#     end
#   end
#
# Remember that you can still open your own transactions, even if you
# are in a Migration with <tt>self.disable_ddl_transaction!</tt>.

  # are handled by the Inflector class in Active Support, which knows almost all common
  # English inflections. You can add new inflections in config/initializers/inflections.rb.
  #
  # Nested classes are given table names prefixed by the singular form of
  # the parent's table name. Enclosing modules are not considered.

  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
  #   end
  #
  #   file                  class               table_name
  #   invoice.rb            Invoice             invoices
  #
  #   class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     class Lineitem < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   file                  class               table_name
  #   invoice.rb            Invoice::Lineitem   invoice_lineitems
  #
  #   module Invoice
  #     class Lineitem < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   file                  class               table_name
  #   invoice/lineitem.rb   Invoice::Lineitem   lineitems
  #
  # Additionally, the class-level +table_name_prefix+ is prepended and the
  # +table_name_suffix+ is appended. So if you have "myapp_" as a prefix,
  # the table name guess for an Invoice class becomes "myapp_invoices".
  # Invoice::Lineitem becomes "myapp_invoice_lineitems".
  #
  # You can also set your own table name explicitly:
  #
  #   class Mouse < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     self.table_name = "mice"
  #   end
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/model_schema.rb:179

  # Sets the table name explicitly. Example:
  #
  #   class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     self.table_name = "project"

# = Active Record Nested Attributes
#
# Nested attributes allow you to save attributes on associated records
# through the parent. By default nested attribute updating is turned off
# and you can enable it using the accepts_nested_attributes_for class
# method. When you enable nested attributes an attribute writer is
# defined on the model.
#
# The attribute writer is named after the association, which means that
# in the following example, two new methods are added to your model:
#
# <tt>author_attributes=(attributes)</tt> and
# <tt>pages_attributes=(attributes)</tt>.
#
#   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_one :author
#     has_many :pages
#
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :author, :pages
#   end
#
# Note that the <tt>:autosave</tt> option is automatically enabled on every
# association that accepts_nested_attributes_for is used for.
#
# === One-to-one
#
# Consider a Member model that has one Avatar:
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_one :avatar
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar
#   end
#
# Enabling nested attributes on a one-to-one association allows you to
# create the member and avatar in one go:
#
#   params = { member: { name: 'Jack', avatar_attributes: { icon: 'smiling' } } }
#   member = Member.create(params[:member])
#   member.avatar.id # => 2
#   member.avatar.icon # => 'smiling'
#
# It also allows you to update the avatar through the member:
#
#   params = { member: { avatar_attributes: { id: '2', icon: 'sad' } } }
#   member.update params[:member]
#   member.avatar.icon # => 'sad'
#
# If you want to update the current avatar without providing the id, you must add <tt>:update_only</tt> option.
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_one :avatar
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, update_only: true
#   end
#
#   params = { member: { avatar_attributes: { icon: 'sad' } } }
#   member.update params[:member]
#   member.avatar.id # => 2
#   member.avatar.icon # => 'sad'
#
# By default you will only be able to set and update attributes on the
# associated model. If you want to destroy the associated model through the
# attributes hash, you have to enable it first using the
# <tt>:allow_destroy</tt> option.
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_one :avatar
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, allow_destroy: true
#   end
#
# Now, when you add the <tt>_destroy</tt> key to the attributes hash, with a
# value that evaluates to +true+, you will destroy the associated model:
#
#   member.avatar_attributes = { id: '2', _destroy: '1' }
#   member.avatar.marked_for_destruction? # => true
#   member.save
#   member.reload.avatar # => nil
#
# Note that the model will _not_ be destroyed until the parent is saved.
#
# Also note that the model will not be destroyed unless you also specify
# its id in the updated hash.
#
# === One-to-many
#
# Consider a member that has a number of posts:
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts
#   end
#
# You can now set or update attributes on the associated posts through
# an attribute hash for a member: include the key +:posts_attributes+
# with an array of hashes of post attributes as a value.
#
# For each hash that does _not_ have an <tt>id</tt> key a new record will
# be instantiated, unless the hash also contains a <tt>_destroy</tt> key
# that evaluates to +true+.
#
#   params = { member: {
#     name: 'joe', posts_attributes: [
#       { title: 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
#       { title: 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen' },
#       { title: '', _destroy: '1' } # this will be ignored
#     ]
#   }}
#
#   member = Member.create(params[:member])
#   member.posts.length # => 2
#   member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
#   member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen'
#
# You may also set a +:reject_if+ proc to silently ignore any new record
# hashes if they fail to pass your criteria. For example, the previous
# example could be rewritten as:
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, reject_if: proc { |attributes| attributes['title'].blank? }
#   end
#
#   params = { member: {
#     name: 'joe', posts_attributes: [
#       { title: 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
#       { title: 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen' },
#       { title: '' } # this will be ignored because of the :reject_if proc
#     ]
#   }}
#
#   member = Member.create(params[:member])
#   member.posts.length # => 2
#   member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
#   member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen'
#
# Alternatively, +:reject_if+ also accepts a symbol for using methods:
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, reject_if: :new_record?
#   end
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, reject_if: :reject_posts
#
#     def reject_posts(attributes)
#       attributes['title'].blank?
#     end
#   end
#
# If the hash contains an <tt>id</tt> key that matches an already
# associated record, the matching record will be modified:
#
#   member.attributes = {
#     name: 'Joe',
#     posts_attributes: [
#       { id: 1, title: '[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
#       { id: 2, title: '[UPDATED] other post' }
#     ]
#   }
#
#   member.posts.first.title # => '[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
#   member.posts.second.title # => '[UPDATED] other post'
#
# However, the above applies if the parent model is being updated as well.
# For example, If you wanted to create a +member+ named _joe_ and wanted to
# update the +posts+ at the same time, that would give an
# ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error.
#
# By default the associated records are protected from being destroyed. If
# you want to destroy any of the associated records through the attributes
# hash, you have to enable it first using the <tt>:allow_destroy</tt>
# option. This will allow you to also use the <tt>_destroy</tt> key to
# destroy existing records:
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, allow_destroy: true
#   end
#
#   params = { member: {
#     posts_attributes: [{ id: '2', _destroy: '1' }]
#   }}
#
#   member.attributes = params[:member]
#   member.posts.detect { |p| p.id == 2 }.marked_for_destruction? # => true
#   member.posts.length # => 2
#   member.save
#   member.reload.posts.length # => 1
#
# Nested attributes for an associated collection can also be passed in
# the form of a hash of hashes instead of an array of hashes:
#
#   Member.create(
#     name: 'joe',
#     posts_attributes: {
#       first:  { title: 'Foo' },
#       second: { title: 'Bar' }
#     }
#   )
#
# has the same effect as
#
#   Member.create(
#     name: 'joe',
#     posts_attributes: [
#       { title: 'Foo' },
#       { title: 'Bar' }
#     ]
#   )
#
# The keys of the hash which is the value for +:posts_attributes+ are
# ignored in this case.
# However, it is not allowed to use <tt>'id'</tt> or <tt>:id</tt> for one of
# such keys, otherwise the hash will be wrapped in an array and
# interpreted as an attribute hash for a single post.
#
# Passing attributes for an associated collection in the form of a hash
# of hashes can be used with hashes generated from HTTP/HTML parameters,
# where there may be no natural way to submit an array of hashes.
#
# === Saving
#
# All changes to models, including the destruction of those marked for
# destruction, are saved and destroyed automatically and atomically when
# the parent model is saved. This happens inside the transaction initiated
# by the parent's save method. See ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation.
#
# === Validating the presence of a parent model
#
# If you want to validate that a child record is associated with a parent
# record, you can use the +validates_presence_of+ method and the +:inverse_of+
# key as this example illustrates:
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_many :posts, inverse_of: :member
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts
#   end
#
#   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :member, inverse_of: :posts
#     validates_presence_of :member
#   end
#
# Note that if you do not specify the +:inverse_of+ option, then
# Active Record will try to automatically guess the inverse association
# based on heuristics.
#
# For one-to-one nested associations, if you build the new (in-memory)
# child object yourself before assignment, then this module will not
# overwrite it, e.g.:
#
#   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_one :avatar
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar
#
#     def avatar
#       super || build_avatar(width: 200)
#     end
#   end
#
#   member = Member.new
#   member.avatar_attributes = {icon: 'sad'}
#   member.avatar.width # => 200
#
# source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/nested_attributes.rb:283
module ActiveRecord::NestedAttributes::ClassMethods
  # Defines an attributes writer for the specified association(s).
  #
  # Supported options:
  # [:allow_destroy]
  #   If true, destroys any members from the attributes hash with a
  #   <tt>_destroy</tt> key and a value that evaluates to +true+
  #   (eg. 1, '1', true, or 'true'). This option is off by default.
  # [:reject_if]
  #   Allows you to specify a Proc or a Symbol pointing to a method
  #   that checks whether a record should be built for a certain attribute
  #   hash. The hash is passed to the supplied Proc or the method
  #   and it should return either +true+ or +false+. When no +:reject_if+
  #   is specified, a record will be built for all attribute hashes that
  #   do not have a <tt>_destroy</tt> value that evaluates to true.
  #   Passing <tt>:all_blank</tt> instead of a Proc will create a proc
  #   that will reject a record where all the attributes are blank excluding
  #   any value for +_destroy+.
  # [:limit]
  #   Allows you to specify the maximum number of associated records that
  #   can be processed with the nested attributes. Limit also can be specified
  #   as a Proc or a Symbol pointing to a method that should return a number.
  #   If the size of the nested attributes array exceeds the specified limit,
  #   NestedAttributes::TooManyRecords exception is raised. If omitted, any
  #   number of associations can be processed.
  #   Note that the +:limit+ option is only applicable to one-to-many
  #   associations.
  # [:update_only]
  #   For a one-to-one association, this option allows you to specify how
  #   nested attributes are going to be used when an associated record already
  #   exists. In general, an existing record may either be updated with the
  #   new set of attribute values or be replaced by a wholly new record
  #   containing those values. By default the +:update_only+ option is +false+
  #   and the nested attributes are used to update the existing record only
  #   if they include the record's <tt>:id</tt> value. Otherwise a new
  #   record will be instantiated and used to replace the existing one.
  #   However if the +:update_only+ option is +true+, the nested attributes
  #   are used to update the record's attributes always, regardless of
  #   whether the <tt>:id</tt> is present. The option is ignored for collection
  #   associations.
  #
  # Examples:
  #   # creates avatar_attributes=
  #   accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, reject_if: proc { |attributes| attributes['name'].blank? }
  #   # creates avatar_attributes=
  #   accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, reject_if: :all_blank

  # Returns an instance of the specified +klass+ with the attributes of the

  # like render <tt>partial: @client.becomes(Company)</tt> to render that

  # Reloads the record from the database.
  #
  # This method finds the record by its primary key (which could be assigned

  #
  #   account = Account.new
  #   # => #<Account id: nil, email: nil>
  #   account.id = 1

  #   # => #<Account id: 1, email: 'account@example.com'>
  #
  # Attributes are reloaded from the database, and caches busted, in
  # particular the associations cache and the QueryCache.
  #
  # If the record no longer exists in the database ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  # is raised. Otherwise, in addition to the in-place modification the method
  # returns +self+ for convenience.
  #
  # The optional <tt>:lock</tt> flag option allows you to lock the reloaded record:
  #
  #   reload(lock: true) # reload with pessimistic locking
  #
  # Reloading is commonly used in test suites to test something is actually
  # written to the database, or when some action modifies the corresponding
  # row in the database but not the object in memory:
  #
  #   assert account.deposit!(25)
  #   assert_equal 25, account.credit        # check it is updated in memory
  #   assert_equal 25, account.reload.credit # check it is also persisted
  #
  # Another common use case is optimistic locking handling:
  #
  #   def with_optimistic_retry
  #     begin
  #       yield
  #     rescue ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError
  #       begin

  #
  # This essentially finds the object (or multiple objects) with the given id, creates a new object
  # from the attributes, and then calls destroy on it.
  #
  # ==== Parameters
  #
  # * +id+ - This should be the id or an array of ids to be destroyed.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   # Destroy a single object
  #   Todo.destroy(1)
  #
  #   # Destroy multiple objects
  #   todos = [1,2,3]

  #
  # For example, +Post.all+ may return Comments, Messages, and Emails
  # by storing the record's subclass in a +type+ attribute. By calling
  # +instantiate+ instead of +new+, finder methods ensure they get new
  # instances of the appropriate class for each record.

  #
  # ==== Parameters
  #
  # * +id+ - This should be the id or an array of ids to be updated.
  # * +attributes+ - This should be a hash of attributes or an array of hashes.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   # Updates one record

  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/relation/query_methods.rb:605
  def rewhere(conditions); end

  # Works in two unique ways.
  #
  # First: takes a block so it can be used just like <tt>Array#select</tt>.
  #
  #   Model.all.select { |m| m.field == value }
  #
  # This will build an array of objects from the database for the scope,
  # converting them into an array and iterating through them using
  # <tt>Array#select</tt>.
  #
  # Second: Modifies the SELECT statement for the query so that only certain
  # fields are retrieved:
  #
  #   Model.select(:field)
  #   # => [#<Model id: nil, field: "value">]
  #
  # Although in the above example it looks as though this method returns an
  # array, it actually returns a relation object and can have other query
  # methods appended to it, such as the other methods in ActiveRecord::QueryMethods.
  #
  # The argument to the method can also be an array of fields.
  #
  #   Model.select(:field, :other_field, :and_one_more)
  #   # => [#<Model id: nil, field: "value", other_field: "value", and_one_more: "value">]
  #
  # You can also use one or more strings, which will be used unchanged as SELECT fields.
  #
  #   Model.select('field AS field_one', 'other_field AS field_two')
  #   # => [#<Model id: nil, field: "value", other_field: "value">]
  #
  # If an alias was specified, it will be accessible from the resulting objects:
  #
  #   Model.select('field AS field_one').first.field_one
  #   # => "value"
  #
  # Accessing attributes of an object that do not have fields retrieved by a select
  # except +id+ will throw ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError:
  #
  #   Model.select(:field).first.other_field
  #   # => ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError: missing attribute: other_field
  #
  # @raise [ArgumentError]
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/relation/query_methods.rb:220

  # Removes an unwanted relation that is already defined on a chain of relations.
  # This is useful when passing around chains of relations and would like to
  # modify the relations without reconstructing the entire chain.
  #
  #   User.order('email DESC').unscope(:order) == User.all
  #
  # The method arguments are symbols which correspond to the names of the methods
  # which should be unscoped. The valid arguments are given in VALID_UNSCOPING_VALUES.
  # The method can also be called with multiple arguments. For example:
  #
  #   User.order('email DESC').select('id').where(name: "John")
  #       .unscope(:order, :select, :where) == User.all
  #
  # One can additionally pass a hash as an argument to unscope specific +:where+ values.
  # This is done by passing a hash with a single key-value pair. The key should be
  # +:where+ and the value should be the where value to unscope. For example:
  #
  #   User.where(name: "John", active: true).unscope(where: :name)
  #       == User.where(active: true)
  #
  # This method is similar to #except, but unlike
  # #except, it persists across merges:
  #
  #   User.order('email').merge(User.except(:order))
  #       == User.order('email')
  #
  #   User.order('email').merge(User.unscope(:order))
  #       == User.all
  #
  # This means it can be used in association definitions:
  #
  #   has_many :comments, -> { unscope(where: :trashed) }
  #
  # source://activerecord-5.2.8.1/lib/active_record/relation/query_methods.rb:363

  def unscope_values=(value); end

  # Returns a new relation, which is the result of filtering the current relation
  # according to the conditions in the arguments.
  #
  # #where accepts conditions in one of several formats. In the examples below, the resulting
  # SQL is given as an illustration; the actual query generated may be different depending
  # on the database adapter.
  #
  # === string
  #
  # A single string, without additional arguments, is passed to the query
  # constructor as an SQL fragment, and used in the where clause of the query.
  #
  #    Client.where("orders_count = '2'")
  #    # SELECT * from clients where orders_count = '2';
  #
  # Note that building your own string from user input may expose your application
  # to injection attacks if not done properly. As an alternative, it is recommended
  # to use one of the following methods.
  #
  # === array
  #
  # If an array is passed, then the first element of the array is treated as a template, and
  # the remaining elements are inserted into the template to generate the condition.
  # Active Record takes care of building the query to avoid injection attacks, and will
  # convert from the ruby type to the database type where needed. Elements are inserted
  # into the string in the order in which they appear.
  #
  #   User.where(["name = ? and email = ?", "Joe", "joe@example.com"])
  #   # SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Joe' AND email = 'joe@example.com';
  #
  # Alternatively, you can use named placeholders in the template, and pass a hash as the
  # second element of the array. The names in the template are replaced with the corresponding
  # values from the hash.
  #
  #   User.where(["name = :name and email = :email", { name: "Joe", email: "joe@example.com" }])
  #   # SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Joe' AND email = 'joe@example.com';
  #
  # This can make for more readable code in complex queries.
  #
  # Lastly, you can use sprintf-style % escapes in the template. This works slightly differently
  # than the previous methods; you are responsible for ensuring that the values in the template
  # are properly quoted. The values are passed to the connector for quoting, but the caller
  # is responsible for ensuring they are enclosed in quotes in the resulting SQL. After quoting,
  # the values are inserted using the same escapes as the Ruby core method +Kernel::sprintf+.
  #
  #   User.where(["name = '%s' and email = '%s'", "Joe", "joe@example.com"])
  #   # SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Joe' AND email = 'joe@example.com';
  #
  # If #where is called with multiple arguments, these are treated as if they were passed as
  # the elements of a single array.
  #
  #   User.where("name = :name and email = :email", { name: "Joe", email: "joe@example.com" })
  #   # SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Joe' AND email = 'joe@example.com';
  #
  # When using strings to specify conditions, you can use any operator available from
  # the database. While this provides the most flexibility, you can also unintentionally introduce
  # dependencies on the underlying database. If your code is intended for general consumption,
  # test with multiple database backends.
  #
  # === hash
  #
  # #where will also accept a hash condition, in which the keys are fields and the values
  # are values to be searched for.
  #
  # Fields can be symbols or strings. Values can be single values, arrays, or ranges.
  #
  #    User.where({ name: "Joe", email: "joe@example.com" })
  #    # SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Joe' AND email = 'joe@example.com'
  #
  #    User.where({ name: ["Alice", "Bob"]})
  #    # SELECT * FROM users WHERE name IN ('Alice', 'Bob')
  #
  #    User.where({ created_at: (Time.now.midnight - 1.day)..Time.now.midnight })
  #    # SELECT * FROM users WHERE (created_at BETWEEN '2012-06-09 07:00:00.000000' AND '2012-06-10 07:00:00.000000')
  #
  # In the case of a belongs_to relationship, an association key can be used
  # to specify the model if an ActiveRecord object is used as the value.
  #
  #    author = Author.find(1)
  #
  #    # The following queries will be equivalent:
  #    Post.where(author: author)
  #    Post.where(author_id: author)
  #
  # This also works with polymorphic belongs_to relationships:
  #
  #    treasure = Treasure.create(name: 'gold coins')
  #    treasure.price_estimates << PriceEstimate.create(price: 125)
  #
  #    # The following queries will be equivalent:
  #    PriceEstimate.where(estimate_of: treasure)
  #    PriceEstimate.where(estimate_of_type: 'Treasure', estimate_of_id: treasure)
  #
  # === Joins
  #
  # If the relation is the result of a join, you may create a condition which uses any of the
  # tables in the join. For string and array conditions, use the table name in the condition.
  #
  #    User.joins(:posts).where("posts.created_at < ?", Time.now)
  #
  # For hash conditions, you can either use the table name in the key, or use a sub-hash.
  #
  #    User.joins(:posts).where({ "posts.published" => true })
  #    User.joins(:posts).where({ posts: { published: true } })
  #
  # === no argument
  #
  # If no argument is passed, #where returns a new instance of WhereChain, that
  # can be chained with #not to return a new relation that negates the where clause.
  #
  #    User.where.not(name: "Jon")
  #    # SELECT * FROM users WHERE name != 'Jon'
  #
  # See WhereChain for more details on #not.
  #
  # === blank condition
  #
  # If the condition is any blank-ish object, then #where is a no-op and returns
  # the current relation.

# {ActiveRecord::Base.transaction}[rdoc-ref:Transactions::ClassMethods#transaction]
# uses this exception to distinguish a deliberate rollback from other exceptional situations.

# the database transaction *and* pass on the exception. But if you raise an
# ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, then the database transaction will be rolled back,
# without passing on the exception.
#
# For example, you could do this in your controller to rollback a transaction:
#
#   class BooksController < ActionController::Base
#     def create
#       Book.transaction do
#         book = Book.new(params[:book])

#           # without telling the user.
#           raise ActiveRecord::Rollback, "Call tech support!"
#         end
#       end
#       # ActiveRecord::Rollback is the only exception that won't be passed on

  # Adds a class method for retrieving and querying objects.
  # The method is intended to return an ActiveRecord::Relation
  # object, which is composable with other scopes.
  # If it returns +nil+ or +false+, an
  # {all}[rdoc-ref:Scoping::Named::ClassMethods#all] scope is returned instead.
  #
  # A \scope represents a narrowing of a database query, such as
  # <tt>where(color: :red).select('shirts.*').includes(:washing_instructions)</tt>.
  #
  #   class Shirt < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }
  #     scope :dry_clean_only, -> { joins(:washing_instructions).where('washing_instructions.dry_clean_only = ?', true) }
  #   end
  #
  # The above calls to #scope define class methods <tt>Shirt.red</tt> and
  # <tt>Shirt.dry_clean_only</tt>. <tt>Shirt.red</tt>, in effect,
  # represents the query <tt>Shirt.where(color: 'red')</tt>.
  #
  # You should always pass a callable object to the scopes defined
  # with #scope. This ensures that the scope is re-evaluated each
  # time it is called.
  #
  # Note that this is simply 'syntactic sugar' for defining an actual
  # class method:
  #
  #   class Shirt < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     def self.red
  #       where(color: 'red')
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Unlike <tt>Shirt.find(...)</tt>, however, the object returned by
  # <tt>Shirt.red</tt> is not an Array but an ActiveRecord::Relation,
  # which is composable with other scopes; it resembles the association object
  # constructed by a {has_many}[rdoc-ref:Associations::ClassMethods#has_many]
  # declaration. For instance, you can invoke <tt>Shirt.red.first</tt>, <tt>Shirt.red.count</tt>,
  # <tt>Shirt.red.where(size: 'small')</tt>. Also, just as with the
  # association objects, named \scopes act like an Array, implementing
  # Enumerable; <tt>Shirt.red.each(&block)</tt>, <tt>Shirt.red.first</tt>,
  # and <tt>Shirt.red.inject(memo, &block)</tt> all behave as if
  # <tt>Shirt.red</tt> really was an array.
  #
  # These named \scopes are composable. For instance,
  # <tt>Shirt.red.dry_clean_only</tt> will produce all shirts that are
  # both red and dry clean only. Nested finds and calculations also work
  # with these compositions: <tt>Shirt.red.dry_clean_only.count</tt>
  # returns the number of garments for which these criteria obtain.
  # Similarly with <tt>Shirt.red.dry_clean_only.average(:thread_count)</tt>.
  #
  # All scopes are available as class methods on the ActiveRecord::Base
  # descendant upon which the \scopes were defined. But they are also
  # available to {has_many}[rdoc-ref:Associations::ClassMethods#has_many]
  # associations. If,
  #
  #   class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_many :shirts
  #   end
  #
  # then <tt>elton.shirts.red.dry_clean_only</tt> will return all of
  # Elton's red, dry clean only shirts.
  #
  # \Named scopes can also have extensions, just as with
  # {has_many}[rdoc-ref:Associations::ClassMethods#has_many] declarations:
  #
  #   class Shirt < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') } do
  #       def dom_id
  #         'red_shirts'
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Scopes can also be used while creating/building a record.
  #
  #   class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
  #   end
  #
  #   Article.published.new.published    # => true
  #   Article.published.create.published # => true
  #
  # \Class methods on your model are automatically available
  # on scopes. Assuming the following setup:
  #
  #   class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
  #     scope :featured, -> { where(featured: true) }
  #
  #     def self.latest_article
  #       order('published_at desc').first
  #     end
  #
  #     def self.titles
  #       pluck(:title)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # We are able to call the methods like this:
  #
  #   Article.published.featured.latest_article
  #   Article.featured.titles

# Store gives you a thin wrapper around serialize for the purpose of storing hashes in a single column.
# It's like a simple key/value store baked into your record when you don't care about being able to
# query that store outside the context of a single record.
#
# You can then declare accessors to this store that are then accessible just like any other attribute
# of the model. This is very helpful for easily exposing store keys to a form or elsewhere that's
# already built around just accessing attributes on the model.
#
# Make sure that you declare the database column used for the serialized store as a text, so there's
# plenty of room.
#
# You can set custom coder to encode/decode your serialized attributes to/from different formats.
# JSON, YAML, Marshal are supported out of the box. Generally it can be any wrapper that provides +load+ and +dump+.
#
# NOTE: If you are using PostgreSQL specific columns like +hstore+ or +json+ there is no need for
# the serialization provided by {.store}[rdoc-ref:rdoc-ref:ClassMethods#store].
# Simply use {.store_accessor}[rdoc-ref:ClassMethods#store_accessor] instead to generate
# the accessor methods. Be aware that these columns use a string keyed hash and do not allow access
# using a symbol.
#
# NOTE: The default validations with the exception of +uniqueness+ will work.
# For example, if you want to check for +uniqueness+ with +hstore+ you will
# need to use a custom validation to handle it.
#
# Examples:
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     store :settings, accessors: [ :color, :homepage ], coder: JSON
#   end
#
#   u = User.new(color: 'black', homepage: '37signals.com')
#   u.color                          # Accessor stored attribute
#   u.settings[:country] = 'Denmark' # Any attribute, even if not specified with an accessor
#
#   # There is no difference between strings and symbols for accessing custom attributes
#   u.settings[:country]  # => 'Denmark'
#   u.settings['country'] # => 'Denmark'
#
#   # Add additional accessors to an existing store through store_accessor
#   class SuperUser < User
#     store_accessor :settings, :privileges, :servants
#   end
#
# The stored attribute names can be retrieved using {.stored_attributes}[rdoc-ref:rdoc-ref:ClassMethods#stored_attributes].
#
#   User.stored_attributes[:settings] # [:color, :homepage]
#
# == Overwriting default accessors
#
# All stored values are automatically available through accessors on the Active Record
# object, but sometimes you want to specialize this behavior. This can be done by overwriting
# the default accessors (using the same name as the attribute) and calling <tt>super</tt>
# to actually change things.
#
#   class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
#     # Uses a stored integer to hold the volume adjustment of the song
#     store :settings, accessors: [:volume_adjustment]
#
#     def volume_adjustment=(decibels)
#       super(decibels.to_i)
#     end

# ActiveRecord::Suppressor prevents the receiver from being saved during
# a given block.
#
# For example, here's a pattern of creating notifications when new comments
# are posted. (The notification may in turn trigger an email, a push
# notification, or just appear in the UI somewhere):
#
#   class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
#     after_create -> { Notification.create! comment: self,
#       recipients: commentable.recipients }
#   end
#
# That's what you want the bulk of the time. New comment creates a new
# Notification. But there may well be off cases, like copying a commentable
# and its comments, where you don't want that. So you'd have a concern
# something like this:
#
#   module Copyable
#     def copy_to(destination)
#       Notification.suppress do
#         # Copy logic that creates new comments that we do not want
#         # triggering notifications.
#       end
#     end

# ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks is a utility class, which encapsulates
# logic behind common tasks used to manage database and migrations.
#
# The tasks defined here are used with Rake tasks provided by Active Record.
#
# In order to use DatabaseTasks, a few config values need to be set. All the needed
# config values are set by Rails already, so it's necessary to do it only if you
# want to change the defaults or when you want to use Active Record outside of Rails
# (in such case after configuring the database tasks, you can also use the rake tasks
# defined in Active Record).
#
# The possible config values are:
#
# * +env+: current environment (like Rails.env).
# * +database_configuration+: configuration of your databases (as in +config/database.yml+).
# * +db_dir+: your +db+ directory.
# * +fixtures_path+: a path to fixtures directory.
# * +migrations_paths+: a list of paths to directories with migrations.
# * +seed_loader+: an object which will load seeds, it needs to respond to the +load_seed+ method.
# * +root+: a path to the root of the application.
#
# Example usage of DatabaseTasks outside Rails could look as such:
#
#   include ActiveRecord::Tasks
#   DatabaseTasks.database_configuration = YAML.load_file('my_database_config.yml')
#   DatabaseTasks.db_dir = 'db'
#   # other settings...
#
#   DatabaseTasks.create_current('production')

# = Active Record \Timestamp
#
# Active Record automatically timestamps create and update operations if the
# table has fields named <tt>created_at/created_on</tt> or
# <tt>updated_at/updated_on</tt>.
#
# Timestamping can be turned off by setting:
#
#   config.active_record.record_timestamps = false
#
# Timestamps are in UTC by default but you can use the local timezone by setting:
#
#   config.active_record.default_timezone = :local
#
# == Time Zone aware attributes
#
# Active Record keeps all the <tt>datetime</tt> and <tt>time</tt> columns
# timezone aware. By default, these values are stored in the database as UTC
# and converted back to the current <tt>Time.zone</tt> when pulled from the database.
#
# This feature can be turned off completely by setting:
#
#   config.active_record.time_zone_aware_attributes = false
#
# You can also specify that only <tt>datetime</tt> columns should be time-zone
# aware (while <tt>time</tt> should not) by setting:
#
#   ActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]
#
# You can also add database specific timezone aware types. For example, for PostgreSQL:
#
#   ActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_types += [:tsrange, :tstzrange]
#
# Finally, you can indicate specific attributes of a model for which time zone
# conversion should not applied, for instance by setting:
#
#   class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
#     self.skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes = [:written_on]

ActiveRecord::Transactions::ACTIONS = T.let(T.unsafe(nil), Array)

# = Active Record Transactions
#
# \Transactions are protective blocks where SQL statements are only permanent
# if they can all succeed as one atomic action. The classic example is a
# transfer between two accounts where you can only have a deposit if the
# withdrawal succeeded and vice versa. \Transactions enforce the integrity of
# the database and guard the data against program errors or database
# break-downs. So basically you should use transaction blocks whenever you
# have a number of statements that must be executed together or not at all.
#
# For example:
#
#   ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
#     david.withdrawal(100)
#     mary.deposit(100)
#   end
#
# This example will only take money from David and give it to Mary if neither
# +withdrawal+ nor +deposit+ raise an exception. Exceptions will force a
# ROLLBACK that returns the database to the state before the transaction
# began. Be aware, though, that the objects will _not_ have their instance
# data returned to their pre-transactional state.
#
# == Different Active Record classes in a single transaction
#
# Though the #transaction class method is called on some Active Record class,
# the objects within the transaction block need not all be instances of
# that class. This is because transactions are per-database connection, not
# per-model.
#
# In this example a +balance+ record is transactionally saved even
# though #transaction is called on the +Account+ class:
#
#   Account.transaction do
#     balance.save!
#     account.save!
#   end
#
# The #transaction method is also available as a model instance method.
# For example, you can also do this:
#
#   balance.transaction do
#     balance.save!
#     account.save!
#   end
#
# == Transactions are not distributed across database connections
#
# A transaction acts on a single database connection. If you have
# multiple class-specific databases, the transaction will not protect
# interaction among them. One workaround is to begin a transaction
# on each class whose models you alter:
#
#   Student.transaction do
#     Course.transaction do
#       course.enroll(student)
#       student.units += course.units
#     end
#   end
#
# This is a poor solution, but fully distributed transactions are beyond
# the scope of Active Record.
#
# == +save+ and +destroy+ are automatically wrapped in a transaction
#
# Both {#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save] and
# {#destroy}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy] come wrapped in a transaction that ensures
# that whatever you do in validations or callbacks will happen under its
# protected cover. So you can use validations to check for values that
# the transaction depends on or you can raise exceptions in the callbacks
# to rollback, including <tt>after_*</tt> callbacks.
#
# As a consequence changes to the database are not seen outside your connection
# until the operation is complete. For example, if you try to update the index
# of a search engine in +after_save+ the indexer won't see the updated record.
# The #after_commit callback is the only one that is triggered once the update
# is committed. See below.
#
# == Exception handling and rolling back
#
# Also have in mind that exceptions thrown within a transaction block will
# be propagated (after triggering the ROLLBACK), so you should be ready to
# catch those in your application code.
#
# One exception is the ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, which will trigger
# a ROLLBACK when raised, but not be re-raised by the transaction block.
#
# *Warning*: one should not catch ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid exceptions
# inside a transaction block. ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid exceptions indicate that an
# error occurred at the database level, for example when a unique constraint
# is violated. On some database systems, such as PostgreSQL, database errors
# inside a transaction cause the entire transaction to become unusable
# until it's restarted from the beginning. Here is an example which
# demonstrates the problem:
#
#   # Suppose that we have a Number model with a unique column called 'i'.
#   Number.transaction do
#     Number.create(i: 0)
#     begin
#       # This will raise a unique constraint error...
#       Number.create(i: 0)
#     rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid
#       # ...which we ignore.
#     end
#
#     # On PostgreSQL, the transaction is now unusable. The following
#     # statement will cause a PostgreSQL error, even though the unique
#     # constraint is no longer violated:
#     Number.create(i: 1)
#     # => "PG::Error: ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands
#     #     ignored until end of transaction block"
#   end
#
# One should restart the entire transaction if an
# ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid occurred.
#
# == Nested transactions
#
# #transaction calls can be nested. By default, this makes all database
# statements in the nested transaction block become part of the parent
# transaction. For example, the following behavior may be surprising:
#
#   User.transaction do
#     User.create(username: 'Kotori')
#     User.transaction do
#       User.create(username: 'Nemu')
#       raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
#     end
#   end
#
# creates both "Kotori" and "Nemu". Reason is the ActiveRecord::Rollback
# exception in the nested block does not issue a ROLLBACK. Since these exceptions
# are captured in transaction blocks, the parent block does not see it and the
# real transaction is committed.
#
# In order to get a ROLLBACK for the nested transaction you may ask for a real
# sub-transaction by passing <tt>requires_new: true</tt>. If anything goes wrong,
# the database rolls back to the beginning of the sub-transaction without rolling
# back the parent transaction. If we add it to the previous example:
#
#   User.transaction do
#     User.create(username: 'Kotori')
#     User.transaction(requires_new: true) do
#       User.create(username: 'Nemu')
#       raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
#     end
#   end
#
# only "Kotori" is created. This works on MySQL and PostgreSQL. SQLite3 version >= '3.6.8' also supports it.
#
# Most databases don't support true nested transactions. At the time of
# writing, the only database that we're aware of that supports true nested
# transactions, is MS-SQL. Because of this, Active Record emulates nested
# transactions by using savepoints on MySQL and PostgreSQL. See
# https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/savepoint.html
# for more information about savepoints.
#
# === \Callbacks
#
# There are two types of callbacks associated with committing and rolling back transactions:
# #after_commit and #after_rollback.
#
# #after_commit callbacks are called on every record saved or destroyed within a
# transaction immediately after the transaction is committed. #after_rollback callbacks
# are called on every record saved or destroyed within a transaction immediately after the
# transaction or savepoint is rolled back.
#
# These callbacks are useful for interacting with other systems since you will be guaranteed
# that the callback is only executed when the database is in a permanent state. For example,
# #after_commit is a good spot to put in a hook to clearing a cache since clearing it from
# within a transaction could trigger the cache to be regenerated before the database is updated.
#
# === Caveats
#
# If you're on MySQL, then do not use Data Definition Language (DDL) operations in nested
# transactions blocks that are emulated with savepoints. That is, do not execute statements
# like 'CREATE TABLE' inside such blocks. This is because MySQL automatically
# releases all savepoints upon executing a DDL operation. When +transaction+
# is finished and tries to release the savepoint it created earlier, a
# database error will occur because the savepoint has already been
# automatically released. The following example demonstrates the problem:
#
#   Model.connection.transaction do                           # BEGIN
#     Model.connection.transaction(requires_new: true) do     # CREATE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
#       Model.connection.create_table(...)                    # active_record_1 now automatically released
#     end                                                     # RELEASE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
#                                                             # ^^^^ BOOM! database error!
#   end
#
# Note that "TRUNCATE" is also a MySQL DDL statement!

  #   attribute is blank (default is +false+).
  # * <tt>:if</tt> - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine
  #   if the validation should occur (e.g. <tt>if: :allow_validation</tt>,
  #   or <tt>if: Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step > 2 }</tt>). The method,

  # === Concurrency and integrity
  #
  # Using this validation method in conjunction with
  # {ActiveRecord::Base#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save]
  # does not guarantee the absence of duplicate record insertions, because
  # uniqueness checks on the application level are inherently prone to race
  # conditions. For example, suppose that two users try to post a Comment at
  # the same time, and a Comment's title must be unique. At the database-level,
  # the actions performed by these users could be interleaved in the following manner:
  #
  #               User 1                 |               User 2
  #  ------------------------------------+--------------------------------------
  #  # User 1 checks whether there's     |
  #  # already a comment with the title  |
  #  # 'My Post'. This is not the case.  |
  #  SELECT * FROM comments              |
  #  WHERE title = 'My Post'             |
  #                                      |
  #                                      | # User 2 does the same thing and also
  #                                      | # infers that their title is unique.
  #                                      | SELECT * FROM comments
  #                                      | WHERE title = 'My Post'
  #                                      |
  #  # User 1 inserts their comment.     |
  #  INSERT INTO comments                |
  #  (title, content) VALUES             |
  #  ('My Post', 'hi!')                  |
  #                                      |
  #                                      | # User 2 does the same thing.
  #                                      | INSERT INTO comments
  #                                      | (title, content) VALUES
  #                                      | ('My Post', 'hello!')
  #                                      |
  #                                      | # ^^^^^^
  #                                      | # Boom! We now have a duplicate
  #                                      | # title!
  #
  # The best way to work around this problem is to add a unique index to the database table using
  # {connection.add_index}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionAdapters::SchemaStatements#add_index].
  # In the rare case that a race condition occurs, the database will guarantee
  # the field's uniqueness.
  #
  # When the database catches such a duplicate insertion,
  # {ActiveRecord::Base#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save] will raise an ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid
  # exception. You can either choose to let this error propagate (which
  # will result in the default Rails exception page being shown), or you
  # can catch it and restart the transaction (e.g. by telling the user
  # that the title already exists, and asking them to re-enter the title).
  # This technique is also known as
  # {optimistic concurrency control}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control].
  #
  # The bundled ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters distinguish unique index
  # constraint errors from other types of database errors by throwing an
  # ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique exception. For other adapters you will
  # have to parse the (database-specific) exception message to detect such
  # a case.
  #
  # The following bundled adapters throw the ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique exception:
  #
  # * ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Mysql2Adapter.
  # * ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.
  # * ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter.
