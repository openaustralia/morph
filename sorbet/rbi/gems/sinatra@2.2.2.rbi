# Rack::Builder implements a small DSL to iteratively construct Rack
# applications.
#
# Example:
#
#  require 'rack/lobster'
#  app = Rack::Builder.new do
#    use Rack::CommonLogger
#    use Rack::ShowExceptions
#    map "/lobster" do
#      use Rack::Lint
#      run Rack::Lobster.new
#    end
#  end
#
#  run app
#
# Or
#
#  app = Rack::Builder.app do
#    use Rack::CommonLogger
#    run lambda { |env| [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ['OK']] }
#  end
#
#  run app
#
# +use+ adds middleware to the stack, +run+ dispatches to an application.
# You can use +map+ to construct a Rack::URLMap in a convenient way.
#
# source://sinatra-2.2.2/lib/sinatra/main.rb:52
class Rack::Builder
  include ::Sinatra::Delegator

  # Initialize a new Rack::Builder instance.  +default_app+ specifies the
  # default application if +run+ is not called later.  If a block
  # is given, it is evaluted in the context of the instance.
  #
  # @return [Builder] a new instance of Builder
  #
  # source://rack-2.2.4/lib/rack/builder.rb:123
  def initialize(default_app = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Call the Rack application generated by this builder instance. Note that
  # this rebuilds the Rack application and runs the warmup code (if any)
  # every time it is called, so it should not be used if performance is important.
  #
  # source://rack-2.2.4/lib/rack/builder.rb:243

  # in to_app.

  def freeze_app; end

  # Creates a route within the application.  Routes under the mapped path will be sent to
  # the Rack application specified by run inside the block.  Other requests will be sent to the
  # default application specified by run outside the block.

  #     map '/heartbeat' do
  #       use Middleware
  #       run Heartbeat
  #     end
  #     run App
  #   end
  #
  # This example includes a piece of middleware which will run before +/heartbeat+ requests hit +Heartbeat+.
  #
  # Note that providing a +path+ of +/+ will ignore any default application given in a +run+ statement
  # outside the block.
  #
  # source://rack-2.2.4/lib/rack/builder.rb:219

  # The simplest form of this is a lambda object:
  #
  #   run lambda { |env| [200, { "Content-Type" => "text/plain" }, ["OK"]] }
  #
  # However this could also be a class:
  #

  #
  #   use Middleware
  #   run lambda { |env| [200, { "Content-Type" => "text/plain" }, ["OK"]] }

# A poor man's ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess, with all the Rails-y

# Implements a hash where keys <tt>:foo</tt> and <tt>"foo"</tt> are
# considered to be the same.
#
#   rgb = Sinatra::IndifferentHash.new
#
#   rgb[:black]    =  '#000000' # symbol assignment
#   rgb[:black]  # => '#000000' # symbol retrieval

#
#   rgb['white']   =  '#FFFFFF' # string assignment
#   rgb[:white]  # => '#FFFFFF' # symbol retrieval
#   rgb['white'] # => '#FFFFFF' # string retrieval
#
# Internally, symbols are mapped to strings when used as keys in the entire
# writing interface (calling e.g. <tt>[]=</tt>, <tt>merge</tt>). This mapping
# belongs to the public interface. For example, given:
#
#   hash = Sinatra::IndifferentHash.new(:a=>1)
#
# You are guaranteed that the key is returned as a string:
#
#   hash.keys # => ["a"]
#
# Technically other types of keys are accepted:
#
#   hash = Sinatra::IndifferentHash.new(:a=>1)
#   hash[0] = 0
#   hash # => { "a"=>1, 0=>0 }
#
# But this class is intended for use cases where strings or symbols are the
# expected keys and it is convenient to understand both as the same. For
# example the +params+ hash in Sinatra.
