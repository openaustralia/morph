<% if @user.never_alerted? %>
Hello and welcome to your <%= hostname %> alert email.

You're getting this because you signed up for <%= hostname %> and a scraper you're
watching has a problem that you might like to fix.

Rather not get these emails? You can unwatch scrapers anytime:
<%= watching_user_url(@user, @analytics_params) %>

<% end %>
<%= hostname %> is letting you know that

<%= alert_scrapers_summary_sentence(@successful_scrapers.count, @broken_scrapers.count) %>

<% @broken_scrapers.each do |scraper| %>
<%= scraper.full_name %> errored
<% if scraper.latest_successful_run_time %>
It has been erroring for <%= time_ago_in_words(scraper.latest_successful_run_time) %>
<% else %>
It has never run successfully
<% end %>
Fix it: <%= scraper_url(scraper, @analytics_params) %>

<%= scraper.last_run.error_text.split("\n")[0..4].join("\n") %>
<% if scraper.last_run.error_text.split("\n").count > 5 %>
(truncated)
<% end %>


<% end %>

Annoyed by these emails? Then change what you're watching - <%= watching_user_url(@user, @analytics_params) %>
<%= hostname %> - <%= root_url(@analytics_params) %>
