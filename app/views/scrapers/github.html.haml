  %h1 Add scraper from your Github repository

  :markdown
    Scrapers can be written in Ruby, PHP or Python. For Ruby They need to have a file in the root
    directory called `scraper.rb`, for PHP `scraper.php`, for Python `scraper.py` and for Perl `scraper.pl`.
    They should create an sqlite database in the current working directory called `#{Morph::Database.sqlite_db_filename}`.
    The main data should be written into a table called `#{Morph::Database.sqlite_table_name}`.
    The code needs to live in the master branch of the repository.
